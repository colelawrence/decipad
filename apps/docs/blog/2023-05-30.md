### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>

- **With this update we are introducing the `first` keyword for table formulas.** It let's you add logic to your formulas by checking for the first row. For example, it allows you to showcase a different message on the first row: `if first then "I am the first row" else "I am not the first row"`. Or compute income increases based on a set value from a slider: `if first then IncomeSlider else previous(0) + 5%`.
- **Enhanced flexibility in table formulas**. Previously, you could only reference columns to the left of the current formula, but now you can reference any column in your table, providing more versatility when putting tables together.
- **New layout options with side-by-side paragraphs, callouts, quotes, and images.** Simply drag these elements to the side and release when you see a vertical line to stack them together. These elements can be stacked with each other and widgets.
- **Improved styles for block multi-selection**, now compatible with dark mode. You can select multiple blocks by clicking and dragging from the side of your notebook, making it easier to rearrange content.
- Duplicating an archived notebook now moves it to your workspace instead of your archive.
- Formulas no longer cause crashes when using negative currencies with parentheses.
- Editing widget names no longer affects their height.
- Table formulas are now non-editable for readers.
- Table autocomplete was fixed to insert the correct columns.
