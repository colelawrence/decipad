### **Important Notice: <br/> Potential Impact on Your Notebooks with Upcoming Upgrade**

We're planning an upgrade to the language engine on **July 6th**. <br/>This upgrade may have an impact on some of your existing work and is essential to unlock enhanced flexibility for modeling in the future.

Here are the features that may be affected by this upgrade:
- References to columns which share the same name as a global variable.
- Any calculations, charts or data views that rely on these results.

If any notebooks break due to the upgrade, our support team is ready to assist you. Just reach out to us at support@decipad.com or click the help button on the bottom corner of your notebook.
