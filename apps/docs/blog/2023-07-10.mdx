### Notebook Sidebar

We have introduced a new sidebar for notebooks that offers the following features:

- **Improved Block Insertion**: You now have the convenience of searching for and inserting new blocks into your notebook using the "+Insert" tab. This offers an alternative method to the existing / slash command for block insertion.
- **Effortless Notebook Results**: The "Data" tab has replaced the previous number's catalog. With this new tab, you can easily search for desired results and drag & drop them directly into your notebook.
- **Hide Sidebar Option**: To optimize your workspace, we have included a sidebar toggle on the top bar. This allows you to hide the sidebar when it's not in use, providing you with a clutter-free environment.
