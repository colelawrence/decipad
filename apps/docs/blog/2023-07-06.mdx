### **Important Notice: <br/> Potential Impact on Your Notebooks with Upcoming Upgrade**

This upgrade may affect some of your existing work but is necessary to enable improved modeling flexibility in the future.

The following features may be affected by this upgrade:

- References to columns that have the same name as a global variable.
- Any calculations, charts, or data views that depend on these results.

If any notebooks break due to the upgrade, our support team is ready to assist you. Please contact us at support@decipad.com or click the help button in the bottom corner of your notebook.

### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>

- **Notebooks UI**: Notebooks now have a consistent design for tables and calculations, using the same colors for variable names. The notebook colors have also been adjusted to be less distracting when working with numbers.
- **Notebook Crashes**: Fixed issues where notebooks would crash when using the `lookup()` function and redefining existing variables.
- **Autocomplete Fixed**: Fixed an issue where certain variable types were missing from the autocomplete feature.
- **Dimensions**: Fixed labels for tables with dimensions and pagination.
- **Transforming Blocks**: Fixed a bug where the "Turn into" options were not working properly.
