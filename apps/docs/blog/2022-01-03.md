Have you ever tried to **understand how a small change in your initial assumptions affect an outcome**? When working with data and numbers, most often we want to **explore a wide range of options** and visualize how they affect a model - preferably in an intuitive and fast way!

### ðŸŒ± New features

- **Weâ€™ve added a slider to our widgetsâ€™ collection** <br></br>
  With this block, everyone will be able to **play around with the slider and experience its effects on the notebook**. We are eager to see the notebooks the community will build with it!
