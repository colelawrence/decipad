### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>

- Longer table formulas fit better inside the formula bar.
- You can now easily update dates on tables and widgets with a date picker.
- You can now display any value as a percentage using `in %` in your calculations. This is handy for situations where you want to display calculation results in a percentage format. Take a look at this party budget table. The last column shows the budget usage in percentage.
- Widgets now show data types, just like tables already do. This will make it easier for you and the reader to know what each widget represents. You can change the widget data type on the `â€¦` menu. Data types include Numbers, Formulas, Text, Dates and Checkboxes.
- Using decimal places on tables no longer removes the units
- Autocomplete for table columns names no longer adds extra words
