We're excited to introduce the **Notebook Data Drawer** â€” a new feature that gives you more control over your notebook variables and streamlines your workflow:

- **Quick Variable Editing:** Easily edit variables directly from the sidebar. Just click on a variable to open the data drawer, where you can update its name, adjust its formula, or delete it.

- **Inline Result Edits:** Modify inline results instantly by clicking on them. The data drawer will open automatically, allowing you to edit variables without leaving your current view.

- **Create and Manage Sidebar Variables:** Now, you can create variables stored exclusively in the sidebar, keeping your main notebook clean and organized.
