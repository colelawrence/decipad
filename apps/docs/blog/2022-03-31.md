### ðŸŒ± New features

---

- **Widgets** let everyone interact with your model when you publish it.

  - Number field, (live)
  - Slider (coming soon!)
  - Date-picker (coming soon!)

- **Variable Bubbles**. Calculation blocks will highlight any custom variable you have named using bubbles. This will make it easier to trace your variables throughout your notebook.

- **Improved Calculation blocks**. Every calculation you add to your notebook now has itâ€™s own block. Why? Over the coming months, calculations will get more flexible, low-code and interactive ðŸŽ‰.<br></br>**Tip:** Use `Ctrl + Enter` when you are in a calculation block to quickly create a new block below.

- **Easier Columns**. The Decipad Language now allows you to add columns directly to a table. myTable.newColumnName = aNewColumn. Donâ€™t forget that all columns must be the same size ðŸ˜‰
