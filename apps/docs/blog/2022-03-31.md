### <FancyTitle icon={Stars}>New Features</FancyTitle>

**Input Widget**. We've introduced a new input widget that lets anyone interact with your model when you publish it.

**Variable Bubbles**. Calculation blocks will highlight any custom variable you have named using bubbles. This will make it easier to trace your variables throughout your notebook.

**Improved Calculation blocks**. Every calculation you add to your notebook now has its own block. <br></br>**Tip:** Use `Ctrl + Enter` when you are in a calculation block to quickly create a new block below.

**Easier Columns**. The Decipad Language now allows you to add columns directly to a table. myTable.newColumnName = aNewColumn. Donâ€™t forget that all columns must be the same size ðŸ˜‰

### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>
