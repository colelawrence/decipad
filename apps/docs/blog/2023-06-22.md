### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>

- **Toggle Widget Update**: The display text of the toggle widget has been revised to show "true" and "false" instead of "On" and "Off" to align with the Decipad language.
- **Enhanced Data Views**: The "Round" option has been renamed to "Cluster," allowing you to modify the formatting of specific numbers or dates.
- **Improved Column Drag and Drop**: The interaction for dragging and dropping columns in both tables and data views has been refined, offering a smoother experience with consistent animations.
- The search functionality in workspaces has been fixed. You can now search by typing just the first letter of a particular notebook.
- Clicking on a section in the numbers catalog will now smoothly scroll it into view without refreshing your notebook unnecessarily.
- Fixed a bug where performing calculations with small exponents would cause the notebook to crash.
