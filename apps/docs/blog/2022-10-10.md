### 🌱 New features
---
- We are introducing a `Result Widget` that lets you highlight any result on your Notebook. Right now, you can’t place Result Widgets side by side. Take a look at this example:
- You can now collapse any table, so it takes less space on your notebook.
- You can now use the plus button to add new blocks to your notebook (in addition to the slash / command shortcut)
- You can now use toggles and data pickers on tables. These help you update booleans and input dates faster.

### 💪 What we’ve improved
---

- Notebooks now load faster for readers.
- We improved the layout and alignment of blocks. It looks a lot cleaner!
- Calculations blocks can now be stacked together.
- You can now reorder widgets individually and place different types of widgets side-by-side.

## 🔨 What’s been fixed
---

- Notebook blocks no longer duplicate themselves randomly.
- A shared notebook now displays the latest changes.
