We're thrilled to unveil our latest feature â€“ Notebook Tabs!

Tabs are here to transform the way you organize your notebooks, offering a world of convenience, improved collaboration, and efficient information management. With Tabs, you can say goodbye to scrolling through endless blocks and welcome a new era of notebook organization.

Here's what Tabs can do for you:

- **Stay Organized**:
  Tabs make organization a breeze. With just a few clicks, you can move your notebook blocks into distinct tabs that relate to specific topics, data sets or context.

- **Publish Better Reports**:
  Tabs aren't just about internal organization; they also empower you to create polished, professional reports. Hide auxiliary calculations and context that only your internal team needs to see by hiding tabs from readers.

- **Easier Navigation**:
  Tabs are accessible from anywhere within your notebook with just a single click. No more scrolling back and forth on your notebook; you can jump straight to the relevant section. Whether you're reviewing, collaborating, or presenting.
