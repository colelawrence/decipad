With this release, we've made significant enhancements to charts.

1. **New Chart Types:** Combine bar and line charts with combo charts, and create funnel and radar charts for more storytelling options.
2. **Stackable:** Place charts side by side to save space or compare metrics easily.
3. **More Flexible:** Now, you can plot multiple columns, turn off the chart grid, add axis labels, and flip orientation for greater customization.
