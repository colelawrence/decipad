### <FancyTitle icon={Stars}>New Features</FancyTitle>

**Currencies on tables**. We've added a new column menu to specify currencies on a table quickly.

**Table cell navigation with keys**. Use `tab` to navigate across columns, `return/enter` to navigate across rows, and the `arrow keys` to move in any direction.

**Flexible ways of inputting numbers on tables**. Add numbers to columns in any way you want, as long as they are compatible. For numbers to be compatible, they need to share the same unit or be able to be converted between each other.

### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>

- You can now use percentages on tables, making them easier to read.
- Hovering number names on calculations now display their correct values.
- Smart rows on tables now work as intended. You can no longer place text there.
