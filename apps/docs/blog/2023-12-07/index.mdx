## Notebook Chat Assistant

 The Notebook Chat Assistant is your smart collaborator for brainstorming, clarifying, and optimizing your data analysis notebooks. For a limited time we are making it available for everyone to give it a try.
 
 Here is what it can do for you:

* Suggest ideas and topics.
* Explain your notebook or template.
* Help you create calculations and models.

To access the AI Chat, just click the AI button on the topbar of your notebook and start your conversation. Let us know your thoughts and feedback by sending us an email ([support@decipad.com](mailto:support@decipad.com)) or via the support chat.
