### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>

- We have made several improvements to tables:
    - **Live connection tables now support up to 50k rows**, allowing you to explore larger data sets while maintaining performance. To keep performance, we have limited the display of sample data to 10 rows.
    - **Input Table performance has been improved**, allowing you to build tables with more rows.
- You can now create inline numbers from data views and table aggregations on the first try.
- Data view titles are now editable again.
- Formatting text in callout blocks no longer displaces the rest of your text.
- We have patched a bug that would prevent the menu block from opening again after it was closed.
- We fixed a bug that caused the notification toast to loop endlessly.
- We have patched a regression that caused adding weeks to dates to stop working.
