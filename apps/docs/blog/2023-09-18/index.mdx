### Embed Decipad Notebooks (Beta)

![Notion Embed](./img/embeds.png)

Many users have asked for the ability to embed their notebooks to share insights with their team and integrate intuitive calculators. Now, you can do exactly that!

Simply publish your notebook, and in the sharing menu, you'll find an additional option to copy the notebook's embed link. We're introducing this feature on select apps such as Notion, ClickUp, monday.com, and Webflow.

If you have other apps in mind or wish to embed Decipad on your website, please reach out to us at [support@decipad.com](mailto:support@decipad.com).
