### <FancyTitle icon={Hammer}>Fixes and Improvements</FancyTitle>

- With Decipad's new auto-detection feature, creating a new variable with the same name as an undefined variable in a broken calculation will automatically update the calculations. This streamlines the process of fixing broken calculations with undefined values.
- The following improvements have been made to widgets:
  - Widgets now have a uniform size, allowing them to stack seamlessly.
  - Sliders now support units before each number. (For example, you can now type $100 instead of 100$ on sliders and nothing will break ðŸŽ‰Â )
- To enhance navigation and data imports:
  - Navigation arrows have been added to long data views, facilitating scrolling through large datasets.
  - Loading animation has been added to provide visual feedback while the data loads during imports.
- In addition, several issues have been addressed, including:
  - Fixing overlapping labels on charts as well as the option to create pie charts from tables.
  - Negative numbers not working properly on some type of calculations.
