### <FancyTitle icon={Stars}>New Features</FancyTitle>

**Magic Numbers**. Reference your results within your text to keep your comments updated with your model. To add these magic numbers to your notebook type `% your-variable %`.

**Notebook Colors**.
Make notebooks your own with the new color and icon picker. Add color to widgets, callouts, tables and notebook icons. Your imagination will be the limit.

**New ‘/’ command Blocks**.
Now you are able to add callouts and dividers to your Notebooks! Just type / to start using them.

**Proportions & Units**.
Units now support qualities. For instance, `1 kilogram of flour` and `720 grams of water` are both represented by units of mass with different qualities (`flour` and `water`).

**Rich text on quotes blocks**

**Text highlighting**
