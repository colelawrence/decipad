### ðŸŒ± New features
---
- Weâ€™ve introduced a **catalog that showcases all numbers youâ€™ve defined in your notebook**, making them accessible at a glance. This will help you:
    - See all numbers you have defined in one place
    - Quickly drag them from the catalog into your calculations or text
    - Navigate your notebook by sections

- **We have a new dropdown widget** that lets you create lists of values anyone can pick from. This widget is great for calculations where you donâ€™t want to input new values, but instead, pick from a list.

### ðŸ’ªÂ What weâ€™ve improved
---

- Weâ€™ve updated Decipadâ€™s font to make numbers standout
- Formulas on tables can be hidden
- You now have the option to use `for` instead of `*` when making multiplications. For example, before `$400 per month * 1 year` now `$400 per month for 1 year`
- You can now control the number of rows with a variable on language tables
- Weâ€™ve added currency support for the Ukrainian hryvnia  ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. Example  `400 UAH`

## ðŸ”¨Â Whatâ€™s been fixed
---
- When you create calculations with dates, these will keep your original units. (Calculations using days will have a result in days, for example)
- We fixed an issue where images on public notebooks could be deleted by users with read-only access.
- We fixed an issue where tables wouldnâ€™t scroll all the way to the left.
