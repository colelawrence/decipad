## New Workspace Plans

We've simplified our workspace plans to make collaboration easier and more accessible for you and your team. Here are the key changes:

- Plus and Business workspaces now offer the option to publish notebooks privately via a URL, restricting access to only those with the link.
- Free workspaces receive 500 AI credits and 10 integration queries as one-time offers. Plus and Business workspaces receive additional credits in each billing cycle.
- Plus and Business workspaces support exporting notebook tables to CSV files.
- The submit form block is exclusively available on Plus and Business plans.
- For notebook collaboration, Free workspaces can invite up to 3 readers per notebook. Plus workspaces allow up to 2 editors and 5 readers per notebook, while Business workspaces support up to 5 editors and unlimited readers.
- Regarding workspace collaboration, Plus workspaces can have up to 2 editors or admins, while Business workspaces can have up to 5 editors or admins.

If you're currently on a Pro plan, your billing remains unchanged, and your workspace will have access to all features available in Plus.
