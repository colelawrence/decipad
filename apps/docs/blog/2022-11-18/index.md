### <FancyTitle icon={Stars}>New Features</FancyTitle>

![Detect Numbers Demo](./img/DetectNumbers.gif)

**Numbers are now automatically detected in text**, allowing you to easily turn them into calculations

**Updating your calculations just got easier and more flexible** <br></br>When you rename a variable, it will update everywhere it is used, meaning your calculations will no longer break. The only exception is renaming column names. We’re actively working on this!

**We’ve also added 3 new features to the bottom right of your notebook**:
* `Undo` and `Redo` buttons to revert any steps on your notebook.
* A `Status Indicator` that lets you know if your changes have been saved.
* A `Help Button` to contact the team, share feedback, and check our docs.
