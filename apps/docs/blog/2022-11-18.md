### 🌱 New features

---

- **Numbers are now automatically detected in text, allowing you to easily turn them into calculations.**

- **Updating your calculations just got easier and more flexible**. When you rename a variable, it will update everywhere it is used, meaning your calculations will no longer break. The only exception is renaming column names. We’re actively working on this!

- **We’ve also added 3 new features to the bottom right of your notebook**:
  - `Undo` and `Redo` buttons to revert any steps on your notebook.
  - A `Status Indicator` that lets you know if your changes have been saved.
  - A `Help Button` to contact the team, share feedback, and check our docs.
