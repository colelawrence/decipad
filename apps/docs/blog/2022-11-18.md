### ðŸŒ± New features

* ** Numbers are now automatically detected in text** <br></br> allowing you to turn them into calculations easily!

* **Updating your calculations just got easier and more flexible**<br></br>
When you rename a variable, it will update everywhere it is used, meaning your calculations will no longer break.

* **Weâ€™ve also added 3 new features to the bottom right of your notebook**
  * `Undo` and `Redo` buttons to revert any steps on your notebook.
  * A `Status Indicator` that lets you know if your changes have been saved.
  *  A `Help Button` to ask for help from the team, share feedback, and check the docs.

### ðŸ’ªÂ What weâ€™ve improved
---
* Calculation blocks and workspaces were optimized for mobile
* Autocomplete menu was updated to include a tooltip to exit
* You can now place result widgets side-by-side
