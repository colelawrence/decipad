- **You can now check our updates inside the app.** It’s as simple as going to the Help button located at the bottom right of your screen and clicking **What’s new.**
- **You can now look at any subtotals as a percentage with Data Views**. Just select % of total on your data view aggregation’s menu.
- **We’ve made it easier for you to add spaces between blocks and new rows on tables**. Just hover the desired spot and press the + button that appears. No more misclicks.
- We've fixed the shortcut that lets you continue on another calculation block by pressing Shift+Enter.
- We've fixed the Drag & Drop functionality on Firefox.
- We've fixed the missing icons from Safari.
- Transforming blocks with the turn into feature has been patched and no longer breaks your smart references.
