## Collaborate in Real-time on Models and Reports

**Decipad now allows you to invite teammates** to collaborate on your notebooks by simply entering their email. No prior account is required.

- **To invite someone as a collaborator or reader,** click the `+` button near your avatar on the top bar of your notebooks, select a role, and add their emails.
- **To find notebooks shared with you**, go to your workspace and select **Shared with me** on the left**.** Alternatively**,** you can also click the link we send to your email.

## Create Formulas Everyone Understands

![FORMULAS](./img/image_str-inp.png)

**We’ve introduced a new block to clearly define inputs and formulas**, making it easier for you and your team to understand the context when exploring calculations.

- **To add this new block to your notebook,** simply type `=`.
Alternatively, type `/` or click the `+` button to open the block menu and search for **Number Input** or **Formula.**
- **The original Decipad calculation blocks are still there,** so existing notebooks won’t be affected. You can find these original blocks on the menu under their new name: **Advanced Formulas.**

## Better Inspection for Inline Numbers

We have enhanced the inspector for inline numbers, allowing you to explore the formulas behind the numbers, make quick edits, and update their name.
