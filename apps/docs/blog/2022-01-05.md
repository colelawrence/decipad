Notebooks got a new look with this release. Check out the differences 😱. What do you think?

### 🌱 New features

---

- **New ‘/’ command Blocks**
  Now you are able to add callouts and dividers to your Notebooks! Just type / to start using them.

- **Proportions & Units**
  Units now support qualities. For instance, `1 kilogram of flour` and `720 grams of water` are both represented by units of mass with different qualities (`flour` and `water`).
