We're thrilled to bring you our latest update: improved layouts in Decipad. These enhancements are designed to make your notebook experience smoother, more organized, and visually appealing:

- **Full-Width Blocks:** Enjoy a more streamlined and flexible experience with the option to use full-width blocks in your notebooks. This option eliminates excessive scrolling and reduces unnecessary whitespace, making it easier to read and navigate large models.

- **Multiple Column Layouts:** Use your notebook to create powerful dashboards with the ability to arrange blocks, including input and result widgets, into multiple columns.

- **Customizable Widget Sizes:** Achieve greater control over your notebook layout with adjustable widget sizes. When using multiple columns, you can now resize input and result widgets to fit your specific needs.
