              <b>Fees:</b> To the extent the Service or any portion thereof is
              made available for any fee, you will be required to select a
              payment plan and provide Decipad information regarding your credit
              card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to
              Decipad that such information is true and that you are authorized
              to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your
              account information with any changes (for example, a change in
              your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may
              occur. You agree to pay Decipad the amount that is specified in
              the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and
              this Terms of Service. You hereby authorize Decipad to bill your
              payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance
              with the terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate
              your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so
              incurred. If you dispute any charges, you must let Decipad know
              within sixty (60) days after the date that Decipad charges you. We
              reserve the right to change Decipad’s prices. If Decipad does
              change the price of a paid subscription, Decipad will provide
              notice of the change on the Site or in email to you, at Decipad’s
              option, at least 30 days before the change is to take effect. Your
              continued use of the Service after the price change becomes
              effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.
              Decipad may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full
              payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by
              Decipad thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice, or
              the Services may be terminated. Unpaid invoices are subject to a
              finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or
              the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all
              expenses of collection. You shall be responsible for all taxes

            <h2>Indemnity and Release</h2>
            <p>

              (collectively, “Indemnitees”) harmless from any from any and all

              rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death)
              arising out of or relating to your use of the Service, any User

              Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no obligation to
              indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnitee from or against any
              liability, losses, damages or expenses incurred as a result of any
              action or inaction of such Indemnitee. If you are a California
              resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which
              says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the
              creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
              time of executing the release, which if known by him must have
              materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a
              resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute
              or doctrine.

            <p>
              This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred
              to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You
              agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may
              arise between you and Decipad, whether arising out of or relating
              to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof),
              the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or
              transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through
              final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance
              with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may
              assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims
              qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you
              from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
              agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
              against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this
              Terms of Service, you and Decipad are each waiving the right to a
              trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights
              will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
              The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
              enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

                YOU AND DECIPAD AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST

            <h3>c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>

            <p>
              Decipad is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
              efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly
              and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at
              support@decipad.com If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party
              who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by
              certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice
              to Decipad should be sent to N1N, Inc., ATTN: Legal Dept, 228 Park
              Ave S PMB 51696 New York, NY 10003-1502 (“Notice Address”). The
              Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
              dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Decipad
              and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days
              after the Notice is received, you or Decipad may commence an
              arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any
              settlement offer made by Decipad or you shall not be disclosed to
              the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount,
              if any, to which you or Decipad is entitled.
            </p>

            <h3>d. Arbitration Procedures</h3>

            <p>
              Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
              accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”)
              rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration
              Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
              Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit
              its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules
              and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer
              arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If
              there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and
              any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of
              this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
              determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
              Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
              arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of
              these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the
              arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues
              relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
              Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are
              usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
              judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages
              and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
              individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.
              Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
              overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unless Decipad and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings
              will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both
              parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and
              other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree
              on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your
              claim is for $10,000 or less, Decipad agrees that you may choose
              whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
              documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
              hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
              Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will
              be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which
              the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a
              reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
              findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
            </p>

            <h3>e. Costs of Arbitration</h3>

            <p>
              Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
              (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA
              Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If
              the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your
              request, Decipad will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of
              relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate
              to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your
              portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
              determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay
              your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Decipad will pay your
              portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the
              arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
              compared to the costs of litigation, Decipad will pay as much of
              the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent
              the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of
              attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
            </p>

            <h3>f. Confidentiality</h3>

            <p>
              All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling,
              decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
              confidential for the benefit of all parties.
            </p>

            <h3>g. Severability</h3>

            <p>
              If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of
              this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled
              “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
              Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the
              parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
              provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
              expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
              provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as
              so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
              provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class
              and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are
              invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration
              Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are
              deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to
              claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of
              Service will continue to apply.
            </p>

            <h3>h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>

            <p>
              Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the
              contrary, Decipad agrees that if it makes any future change to
              this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice
              Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any
              such change by sending Decipad written notice within thirty (30)
              calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
              By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will
              arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language
              of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted
              these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to
              these Terms of Service).
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h2>Termination</h2>

            <p>
              You agree that Decipad, in its sole discretion, may suspend or
              terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service
              and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any
              reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if
              Decipad believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently
              with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected
              fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for
              termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate
              law enforcement authorities. Decipad may also in its sole
              discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or
              any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any
              termination of your access to the Service under any provision of
              this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and
              acknowledge and agree that Decipad may immediately deactivate or
              delete your account and all related information and files in your
              account and/or bar any further access to such files or the
              Service. Further, you agree that Decipad will not be liable to you
              or any third party for any termination of your access to the
              Service.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h2>User Disputes</h2>

            <p>
              You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions
              with any other user in connection with the Service and Decipad
              will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.
              Decipad reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become
              involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user
              of the Service.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h2>General</h2>

            <p>
              These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you
              and Decipad and govern your use of the Service, superseding any
              prior agreements between you and Decipad with respect to the
              Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and
              conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third- party
              services, third party content or third party software. These Terms
              of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California
              without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to
              any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
              above, you and Decipad agree to submit to the personal and
              exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located
              within New York, New York. The failure of Decipad to exercise or
              enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not
              constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision
              of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent
              jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that
              the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’
              intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions
              of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You
              agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
              claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
              Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1)
              year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
              barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice
              given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or
              administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
              agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
              other business documents and records originally generated and
              maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of
              Service without the prior written consent of Decipad, but Decipad
              may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part,
              without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service
              are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
              Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The
              Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms
              of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to
              notices generally on the Service.
