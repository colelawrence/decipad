# Reference Previous Values


**Syntax**:

`previous(InitialValue, [Table.Column])`

References the previous value within a table. The first argument is the initial value, and if you want to reference the previous result in another column, you can pass its name as the second argument.

### Examples

`previous($10) + 5%` adds `$10` to the first row and adds `5%` to each subsequent row, taking into account the previous value.

```deci live
Sales={
  Year=[date(2020)..date(2023)]
  Growth=previous($10) + 5%
}
```

`previous(0, Acquired * 5%)` forecasts the number of customers who churned based on the previous year's acquired clients and a `5%` churn rate.

```deci live
CustomerForecast={
  Year=[date(2020)..date(2023)]
  Acquired=previous(1000 customers) * 200%
  Churned=previous(0, Acquired * 5%)
}
```
