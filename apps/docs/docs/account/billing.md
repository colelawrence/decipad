# --Billing & Payments

## Billing basics

Decipad bills each workspace separately, according to the number of seats. If you belong to multiple workspaces, each workspace will be charged individually for your seat.

Billing intervals are monthly and set per workspace and you will always be billed at the start of your billing interval.
