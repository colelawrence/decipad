# Billing & Cancellations

Decipad offers two plan types: Starter and Pro. The Starter plan is free for individual users, while the Professional (Pro) plan is a paid option billed monthly.

With the Pro plan, you get access to a shared workspace to collaborate with your team and increased data capacity. To find what is included in each plane see [the pricing page](https://www.decipad.com/billing).

## How You're Billed for Adding Workspace Seats

For Pro subscriptions, billing occurs on a monthly basis per workspace and per seat. Your billing cycle starts at the beginning of the subscription period, and the subscription is automatically renewed at the end of each cycle.

When you add new seats to your workspace, you will incur charges based on the following process:

1. You will be charged for each newly added seat, whether they have admin or member access.
2. Our system reviews the number of seats you've added or removed on a monthly basis.
3. The billing is done retroactively on a prorated basis, considering the time the new seats joined your workspace.
4. Your tax amount is determined by the billing information you provide, and entering a tax ID may impact your bill.

**Example:**

- Let's say on 15th August, you upgrade your workspace to a Pro plan. Your billing period runs until 15th September, and your subscription will automatically renew at that time.
- If your monthly subscription cost is $15, and you add 2 more seats to your workspace, your next bill will include $45 ($15 x 3 seats) along with proration for the time the new seats joined during the current billing period.

**Note**: Only workspace administrators are able to manage billing and workspace settings.

## How Decipad Probates Your Bill

Every time there is a change on the number of workspace seats, Decipad adjusts the amount charged so you only pay for the **total of seats you have in your workspace (including members and admins) and for when this number changes**. To calculate the charges, we determine the percentage of time left in your billing cycle when the change occurred and applies this to the charges for the new seats. Here's how it works:

- When new seats join, you pay only for the portion of the billing period they were part of the workspace.
- The same principle applies when seats are removed.

Since you pay at the beginning of each billing interval, any charges (or credits) for changes made during the period are retroactively added to your next invoice.

**Example:**

- You subscribe to the Pro plan on 1st September and pay $15 for the billing period from 1st September to 1st October.
- On 10th September, you add 2 seats to your workspace.
- Your next invoice, due on 1st October, will be $65, calculated as follows:
  - $45 for the 3 seats (your seat and the 2 added seats).
  - $20 for the 20 days of the new added seats within the September billing period.

## Updating Payment Method and Billing Information

To update your payment method and view your billing information, follow these steps:

1. Access "Billing settings" on the sidebar of your your workspace.
2. Provide your **billing email** address and click "Send." You will receive an email with a log in URL to the billing platform.
3. Log in using the provided URL, and you'll be able to access the "Payment method" and "Billing information" sections.

## Invoice History

To review all the invoices for your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Access "Billing settings" on the sidebar of your your workspace.
2. Enter your **billing email** address and click "Send." You will receive an email with a log in URL to the billing platform.
3. Log in using the provided URL, and you'll find the "Invoice history" section displaying all your received and paid invoices.

## Canceling Your Pro Plan

To downgrade from a Pro plan to the free Starter plan, follow these steps:

1. Go to "Billing settings" in the workspace you want to downgrade.
2. Provide your **billing email** address and click "Send." An email with a login URL to the billing platform will be sent to you.
3. Log in using the provided URL, then click on "Cancel plan" in the top right corner of the web page.
4. Click "Cancel plan".

**Note**: When downgrading a Pro plan, your workspace seats **may lose access to it**.

Your subscription will remain active **until the end of your billing period**. After the cancellation date, your plan will be downgraded to Starter. If you decide to continue, you can renew your plan by clicking "Renew plan" on the cancellation page. Renewing your plan will not result in any changes or additional charges to your bill or plan.

## Reasons for Invoice & Plan Price Differences

Invoices and plan prices may differ for several reasons. This can occur due to various changes made to your plan, such as the number of seats, trials, discounts, or adjustments based on Tax ID/billing country. Here are some common scenarios:

- Changes in the number of seats in your workspace during the billing period.
- Account credits applied when you remove seats from your workspace.
- Earned credits (e.g., discounts) used to offset your balance.
- Differences resulting from using a different Tax ID or billing country.

## Deleting your Workspace

To delete your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Open "Workspace settings" for the workspace you wish to cancel.
2. Find the "Delete Workspace" section.
3. Enter the name of the workspace you want to delete (it must match the current workspace name).
4. Click the "Delete" button.

**Note**: Deleting a workspace with a Pro plan will cancel your subscription. Be aware that deleting a workspace also permanently removes all notebooks within it, and this action cannot be undone. Please exercise caution. If you have only one workspace or wish to delete your account, please [contact support](mailto:support@decipad.com).
