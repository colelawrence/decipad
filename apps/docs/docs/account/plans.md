## Upgrading your plan

## Add and remove seats

Your workspace is billed per seat and you can suspend or add any new seats at any time.

Workspace admins can add and remove seats. First, click on your workspace name, select Workspace settings from the dropdown, then Billing in the sidebar. Under Seats, you'll see your current seat limit and usage.

Click Manage members to edit or suspend individual member access from the dropdowns. Click Manage seats to make changes to your seat count and calculate any changes to your billing amount.
