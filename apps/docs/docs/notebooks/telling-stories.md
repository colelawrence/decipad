# Telling Stories

Decipad notebooks aren't just for numbers, narratives are built on top of words. Here are some of the tools you can use to build your story.

## Notebook Names

To organize your notebooks and help tell your story, pick a name for you notebook by defining a title. At Decipad we like to use emojis. Be creative!

## Writing & Styling

### Heading & Sub-Headings

Add headings to you notebook with the '/' command in any paragraph by selecting 'Heading' or 'Sub-heading'.

In alternative, you can use the markdown notation. '\#' followed by "Your Heading" or '\#\#' followed by "Your Sub-Heading" to insert them into any paragraph.

### Styling Paragraphs

To transform your paragraphs you can select the text you wish to change and use the tool menu to pick a style. Currently, the notebook supports bold, italics, underline as well as some custom text decorations as highlighting and code.

## Markdown Support

Besides the styling menu that pops up when you select text, Decipad supports a number of markdown style shortcuts to make editing and writing faster for those of you who prefer. Take a look at the supported shortcuts:
