# Notebooks

Decipad notebooks are a place to communicate thoughts, conclusions and arguments informed by data.

One of the challenges when working with data is how to drive the right conclusions and how to communicate them.

We believe the symbiosis between thoughts and calculations is important since relations between data and narrative are cyclical, most data is better communicated alongside contextual information and most arguments are better informed by data!
