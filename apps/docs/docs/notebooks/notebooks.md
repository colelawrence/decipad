# Notebooks

Decipad notebooks bring together thoughts, data and calculations.

Notebooks are a place to communicate thoughts, conclusions and arguments informed by data.

Relations between data and narrative are cyclical, since most data is better communicated alongside contextual information and most arguments are better informed by data!
