# Backups

During the beta phase of Decipad, we are continuously improving the user experience and working on stability. To ensure the safety of your important data, we provide options for exporting and downloading your notebooks.

## Exporting Notebooks

To export a notebook and create a backup file, follow these steps:

1. Go to your workspace.
2. Hover over the notebook you want to export.
3. Click the `•••` button.
4. Select `Export` from the menu that appears.
5. You can now export your notebook by either:
   - Downloading a notebook JSON file that can be imported into Decipad at a later date.
   - Printing the notebook to a PDF.

You can save these files to a secure location for backup purposes.

## Downloading Old Versions of your Notebook

In addition to manual exports, Decipad also allows you to download previous version of a notebook. Here's how:

1. Go to your workspace.
2. Hover over the notebook you want to download.
3. Click the `•••` button.
4. Select `Version History` from the menu.

A `.zip` file containing several copies with the latest versions of the notebook will be generated for you to download.

## Importing Notebooks

To import a backup or previously exported notebook into any Decipad workspace, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the desired workspace.
2. Drag and drop the `.zip` file of the backup or exported notebook into the workspace.

Decipad will automatically process the file and make the notebook available for use in your workspace.
