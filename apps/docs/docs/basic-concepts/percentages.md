On this example, we are checking how much of the budget was spent and getting that result in a percentage format using **in %**.

## Use Percentages on Calculations

Percentages work natively with any operation.

**Apply a percentage** with multiplication. **10%** of **5** is **0.5**.

### Calculate the percentage for each item in a column

**To calculate the percentage value of each row item**. Add a new column that divides your column by its total amount.
