# Inline Numbers

Inline Numbers let you embed calculation results in your text to help you explain the context. They are also dynamic and update when you make changes to your model.

## Create Inline Numbers with the = shortcut

**Embed any number or calculation when writing a sentence.** <br /> Press the `=` key, and a formula bar will pop up. Type your calculation and see the result embedded in your text.

## Drag & Drop Inline Numbers from your Number's Catalog

**Embed any value from the number's catalog on the left side of your notebook** <br /> Just click and hold the **`â¸¬`** button that shows when you hover a number and drop it on your text.

## Drag & Drop Inline Numbers from Data Views

**Drag any aggregation from a Data View to embed on your text** <br /> Just click and hold any result and drop it to any paragraph.

## Drag & Drop Inline Numbers from Column Results

**Drag any calculation result to embed on your text** <br /> Just click and hold the result on the right of your calculation and drop it on any paragraph.

## Edit Inline Numbers

Click on any inline number derived from a calculation to pull up the formula bar to edit. It will reflect any changes once you exit edit mode.

**Some Inline Numbers can't be edited**. Inline numbers that were created by dragging results from Data Views or Column Results only showcase their formula and can't be edited, only deleted.
