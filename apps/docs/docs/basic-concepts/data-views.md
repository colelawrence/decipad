# Create a Data View

:::caution `Experimental Feature`
Data Views are still in development and are available to everyone to experiment with.
:::

Data Views are table summaries where you can extract insights.

## Add a Data View

* To **add an empty data view**, click the `+` button next to an empty line, and select `Data View` from the menu. Once placed, select a source table from the menu.
* To **add a data view from a table**, click the `Create view` button on the top-right of your [table](/docs/quick-start/tables). <br></br> A new connected table view will be added after your original table.

Each time your original table is updated, your data view will automatically update to reflect the changes.

## Add Columns to a View
Select the table columns you want to showcase on your view.

* To **add columns to a view**, click the `+ Add column` button and select a column. 
* To **remove a column from a view**, click the down triangle button on the column and select `Remove column`.

## Reorder Columns on a View

* To **reorder columns**, click and hold the column you want to reorder and move it to a new position inside the same data view.

## Hide Row Groups

Hide row groups that you don't want to display.

* To **hide a row group**, click the open folder next to a row group.
* To **display a row group**, click the closed folder next to a row group.

## Add Data View Calculations
Add calculations to columns to explore results from row groups.

* To **add calculations to a data view**, click the down triangle button from a column and select an operation from `Calculate`. Check how each row group now has a new line with a result summary.

The order on which columns are added to a data view affect row groups. This lets you explore different calculations.
