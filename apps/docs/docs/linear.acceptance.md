```deci live
Offer = 10 $
Step = 100%

grow(Offer, Step, Duration)
==> [ 10 $, 20 $, 40 $, 80 $, 160 $, 320 $, 640 $, 1280 $, 2560 $, 5120 $ ]
```

```deci live

}

Animals2 = {

  Speed = [27.33 mph, 55 mph]
}

  Speed = [27.33 miles/hour in kilometer/second, 55 miles/hour in kilometer/second]
}

Race = {
  Name = ["Quarter", "Half", "Marathon"]
  Distance = [0.25 marathon, 0.5 marathon, 1 marathon]
}

Hours = round(sum(1/(Animals.Speed / Race.Distance) in hours), 2)
Hours2 = round(sum(1/(Animals2.Speed / Race.Distance) in hours), 2)
Hours3 = round(sum(1/(Animals3.Speed / Race.Distance) in hours), 2)


[Hours, Hours2, Hours3]
==> [ [ 1.68 hours, 0.83 hours ], [ 1.68 hours, 0.83 hours ], [ 1.68 hours, 0.83 hours ] ]
```

Why?

```deci live
Distance = 1.75 marathons in miles
Speed = [27.33 miles/hour, 55 miles/hour]
round(1/(Speed / Distance), 2)
==> [ 1.68 hours, 0.83 hours ]

Part 1: splitby was malfunctioning

```deci live
People = {
  Name = ["Peter", "Paul", "Mary"]
  Origin = ["US", "UK", "US"]
}
Countries = splitby(People, People.Origin)
lookup(Countries, Countries.Origin == "UK")
==> {
  Origin = 'UK',
  Values = {
  Name = [ 'Paul' ]
}
}
```
