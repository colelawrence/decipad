# Notebook Guests

![Invites](./img/image_collab.png)

## Share Your Notebook

1.  Open your notebook and click the `Share` button on the top bar and select `Collaborate`.
2.  Enter the email address and role of the person you want to invite.
3.  Click `Send invite` to send an email with an invite link.

There are two roles you can assign to your teammate:

- `Editor`: can make changes to your notebook.
- `Reader`: has access to read your notebook.

Note: Notebook guests can't publish new changes. Only workspace admins are able to publish new changes to notebooks they didn't author. [Learn more about workspaces →](/share/workspaces)

## Manage Access to Your Notebook

1. Click the `Share` button located on the top bar and choose `Collaborate`.
2. Utilize the role dropdown next to each person's name to adjust permissions.
3. To remove access, press the role dropdown next to the respective person's name and select `Remove`.

**Note**: If your notebook has been published, users with the link will still be able to access your notebook as a reader. <br /> [Learn more about publishing Notebooks →](/docs/share/publish).

## Find Notebooks Shared With You

1.  Go to your workspace.
2.  Select `Shared with me` on the left.
    Alternatively, you can click the link we send to your email each time someone shares a notebook with you.
