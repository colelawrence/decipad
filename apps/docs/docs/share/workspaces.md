# Workspaces

A Workspace in Decipad is a central hub for collaboration and organization. It’s where you can manage your notebooks and collaborate with team members.

## Organize & Manage Notebooks

Within a Workspace, you can create sections to categorize and organize your notebooks effectively and utilize the search functionality to quickly find notebooks based on keywords or titles.

- **Add Sections**: Click on `+ New Section` in the workspace sidebar. Drag and drop notebooks into sections to categorize them.
- **Archive a Notebook**: Hover over the notebook you want to archive in your workspace, click the `•••` button on the right, and select `Archive`.
- **Delete a Notebook**: Navigate to the archived notebooks section in your workspace, hover over the notebook you want to delete, click the `•••` button on the right, and select `Delete`.
- **Duplicate a Notebook**: Hover over the notebook you want to duplicate in your workspace, click the `•••` button on the right, and select `Duplicate`.
- **Download a Notebook**: Hover over the notebook you want to export in your workspace, click the `•••` button, and select `Download`. To import a notebook, simply drag the `.zip` file into any Decipad workspace.

## Invite Guests to Notebooks

Invite guests to specific notebooks as readers or collaborators.

- **Share a Notebook**: Open the notebook you want to share, click on the share icon, and enter the email address of the guest. Choose the appropriate access level (reader or collaborator) and send the invitation.
- **Guest Access**: The shared notebook will appear in the guest's "Shared with Me" section within their workspace.

## Manage Personal Settings

- **Personal Settings**: Click on your profile icon or username in the workspace. There you can modify your username, enable dark mode and logout. [Learn more about Account Settings](/account/settings)

## Manage Workspace Settings

- **Create New Workspace**: Click the downward arrow next to your current workspace name and select "+ Create workspace" from the options. Choose a name for your new workspace and click "Create Workspace".
- **Rename Workspace**: In Workspace settings, enter the new name for your workspace in the rename section. Click the red "Rename" button to confirm the update.
- **Delete Workspace**: Go to Workspace settings and select the delete option. Confirm the deletion by clicking the red "Delete" button.

## Invite and Manage Workspace Members (Pro Feature)

Invite team members to your workspace and collaborate together. Since this is a pro feature you will need to upgrade your workspace. See [Upgrading Plans](/account/plans) to learn more.

- **Invite Members**: Go to Workspace settings > Manage members and enter the email address of the team member you want to invite. Choose the appropriate access level (admin or member) and click the invite button.
- **Manage Permissions**: In Workspace settings > Manage members, use the access level picker next to a member's name to update their access level. To revoke access, click the three-dot menu next to the member's name and select the option to revoke access.

**Note:** Please note that currently, all notebooks created in a workspace are visible to everyone by default. We recommend being cautious about the sensitive information you include until fine-grained permissions are available.
