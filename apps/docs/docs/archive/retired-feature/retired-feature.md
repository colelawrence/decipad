# Retired Feature

On Decipad, we are always improving and experimenting with new features.

Our goal is to give you superpowers when it comes to numbers, and to make them fun and intuitive.
This sometimes means, retiring old features to make space for new and better ones.

## Expanding Tables

Expanding tables would let you take an original language table and reuse its columns on a new one.
You can achieve the same result by creating a new table and adding columns that match the columns you want to copy.
