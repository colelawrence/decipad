### Add Table Calculations

To **add a new calculation to your table**:

1.  Add a new column to your table,
2.  Click the drop-down triangle from your new column and select `Change type`, and then `Formula`. <br />
    See how a new calculation line appears on top of your table.
3.  Write your calculation on the new calculation line and see the results appear in the column.

<br />

### Add a Column Calculation

Add column calculations on the last row of any column to display insights. <br />
Some useful examples are **averages**, **minimum values** and **maximum values** of your column values.

- To add **a column calculation**, go to the last row of any column, click the `Calculate` triangle and select one of the calculations listed.

### Update Column Type

Column types allow you to specify the type of information in each column to help with your calculations. Columns types can be **numbers**, **currencies**, **formulas**, **checkboxes**, **text**, **dates**, and **series**.

- To **update a column type**, click the down triangle button of any column, click `Change type`, and select a new type from the list.

### Add Units to Columns

Units provide context to your numbers and help you create calculations fast. <br />
Any column with numbers on a table can have a unit.

- To **add a unit to a column**, click the down triangle button on a column, click `Change type`, and type your new unit in the `add custom unit` field.

### Add Column Series

Column series allow you to specify a time interval on a column that expands as you add new rows to your table.
To create a column series, pick a starting point in time, and the following dates will be calculated for you.
Series can be spaced in years, months, or days (YYYY, YYYY/MM, YYYY/MM/DD).

- To **add a series to a column**, click the down triangle button on a column, click `Change type`, and select `Series` and then `Date`.<br />
  Then you will be able to specify a moment in time on the first cell of that column (YYYY, YYYY/MM, YYYY/MM/DD).
