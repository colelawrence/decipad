# Import Data

You can easily import data into Decipad using the following methods:

- **Copy & Paste Tables**: Create a table by copying and pasting it from a webpage or document.
- **Upload CSVs**: Import data by dragging and dropping a CSV file into a Decipad notebook or using the `/csv` command.
- **Import Data from Links**: Create a Decipad Table from a Google Sheet or CSV table by pasting their link and selecting `Import`. Ensure your Google Sheet is public if you're importing from there.
- **Connect to Live Data Sources**: Connect a Decipad table directly to a Google Sheet or CSV table to ensure your notebook is always up-to-date. Paste the link and select `Connect`. Again, make sure your Google Sheet is public if you're connecting to it.
- **Connect to APIs with JavaScript**: Retrieve data from web APIs and import it into Decipad using our [JavaScript integration feature](/docs/integrations/code).
- **Connect to SQL Databases**: Retrieve data from SQL Databases and import it into Decipad using our [SQL integration feature](/docs/integrations/code).
