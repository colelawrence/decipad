# Import Data

This is how you can bring data into Decipad:

- **Copy & Paste Tables**: You can quickly create a table by copying and pasting it from a webpage or document.
- **Drag & Drop CSV**: You can import data by dragging and dropping a CSV file into a Decipad notebook.
- **Import Data From a Google Sheet or CSV Link**: You can create a Decipad Table from a Google Sheet or CSV table by pasting their link and selecting `Import`. Make sure your Google Sheet is public if you're importing from there.
- **Connect to Live Data Sources**: You can connect a Decipad table directly to a Google Sheet or CSV table to ensure your notebook is always up-to-date. Paste the link and select `Connect`. Again, make sure your Google Sheet is public if you're connecting to it.
