# Formulas

Formulas are dynamic calculations that are easy to follow and update.

## Create a Formula

**To create a new Formula Block**, Click the `+` button next to an empty line in your notebook and select `Formula` from the menu that appears. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut by typing `=` on an empty paragraph.

1. **Create a Calculation**:

   - Just type any calculation or formulas and check its result on the right.

2. **Define a Variable Name**:

   - Assign variable names to your formulas to make them easier to read and reuse.
   - Variable names are case-sensitive.
   - Variable names cannot include spaces.
   - Variable names cannot start with a number.
   - Variable names must be unique.

3. **Supported Operations**:

   - Formulas support common mathematical operations such as addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and exponents `**`.
   - Parentheses can be used to group operators and define evaluation order. Example: `($100 + 5%) / $200`.

4. **Percentages**:

   - Percentages are fully supported in formulas. Simply add a `%` symbol to any number to define a percentage. Example: `5%`
   - Convert a calculation result into a percentage with the keyword `in`. Example: ` 30/200 in %`.
   - Apply a percentage using multiplication. Example: `400$ * 5%`
   - Add a percentage using addition. Example: `400$ + 5%`
   - Subtract a percentage using subtraction. Example: `400$ - 5%`
   - Combine percentages using addition or subtraction. Example: `10% + 5%`

5. **Shorthand Notation**:

   - Formulas support abbreviated ways of representing numbers and writing expressions:
   - You can use number multipliers, including thousands `K`, millions `M`, and billions `B`.
   - You can use currency symbols such as `$5` or `5$` to represent different currencies. <br/>

6. **Built-in Functions**:

   - Decipad has a series of built-in function that you can use to simplify your calculations. <br/>

7. **Add Units**:

   - To add units you can just type them. For example enter `$10` or `5oz` to indicate a currency or measurement. <br/>

8. **Reference Results**:

   - You can easily drag and drop these calculations into your text to explain them. <br/>[Learn more about Inline Results →](/docs/quick-start/inline-results)
   - You can easily drag and drop these calculations into your formulas to reuse them.

9. **Create a Result Widget**:
   - Click the formula result to create a result widget on your notebook to showcases an important number.

## Number Inputs

You can define number inputs to reuse on your calculations to make your calculations easier to follow and update.

**To create a new Number Input Block**, Click the `+` button next to an empty line in your notebook and select `Number Input` from the menu that appears. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut by typing `=` on an empty paragraph.

1. **Add a Unit**:

   - To add units to number inputs, just type them as text next to your numbers.
   - For example, you can enter `$10` or `5oz` to indicate a currency or measurement.
   - Alternatively, you can click on the unit picker `▼` and select one from the list or define custom one on the `add custom unit` field.

2. **Define a Variable Name**:

   - Assign variable names to your formulas to make them easier to read and reuse.
   - Variable names are case-sensitive.
   - Variable names cannot include spaces.
   - Variable names cannot start with a number.
   - Variable names must be unique.

## Formulas on Tables

- You can add formulas to a table by clicking on any cell and starting with the equals sign (`=`).
- Alternatively, you can add formulas to a column by clicking on the column `▼` and selecting `Formula`.
