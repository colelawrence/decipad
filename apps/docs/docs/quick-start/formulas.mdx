# Create a Formula

Create inline calculations in your notebook with `Formula Blocks`, they can help you:


* Label your data clearly - instead of using "$A$1", you can use formulas that read like a story
* Define the base values of your model so you can build from them and avoid accidentally overwriting your input data.
* Rearrange your formulas as you please - either in a compact list or placed where they make the most sense contextually, like cells but unchained.

## Add a Formula Block to you Notebook

To **add a new formula** to your notebook:

1.  Click the `+` button next to an empty line,
2.  Select `Formula` from the menu.

Alternatively,Â use the shorcut by typing `=` on an empty paragraph.

### Pick a Variable Name for a Formula

Assign variable names to your formulas to reuse on other calculations. Variables make formulas easier to read and recall. On spreadsheets, these are coordinates, for example, A1, B2, etc.

**Here are the rules when picking variable names**:

- Emojis can be used as variable names ðŸ˜Ž.
- Variable names are case-sensitive. For Instance, `Discount` is a different variable from `discount`.
- Variable names canâ€™t include spaces.
- Variable names canâ€™t start with a number.
- Variables names are unique, you canâ€™t assign the same one to different values.

### Supported Operations for Formulas

Decipad supports all the operations you would except. `Addition`, `Subtraction`, `Multiplication`, `Division` and `Exponents`.

### Percentages Work Out-of-the-Box

Percentages are supported in formulas. Just use them as you would with normal numbers.

## Create Numbers Inputs to Reuse

Add `Number Inputs` to define numbers that you can reuse with your formulas. These numbers have variable names that help you add context and make them easier to reause across your model.

Take a look at this example:

![Formula Block](./img/SI_EXAMPLES.png)

Your `FinalSalary` is your `Salary` plus your `Bonus`.

### Pick a Unit for Your Numbers

Specify the units of any number to add extra context to your calculations.

To add units to a number:

1. Click the dropdown picker to select a new unit.
2. To **add custom units to a number**, click the dropdown picker and add them to the `create custom` field.

Check the [list of units Decipad supports by default](/docs/basic-concepts/supported-units).
