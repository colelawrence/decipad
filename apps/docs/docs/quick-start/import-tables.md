# Importing Data into Decipad

:::caution `Experimental Feature`
Importing Data is in development and its features are very limited. <br /> <b>Decipad only supports integrations with Google Sheets</b><br />
Share your ideas and needs to help us improve data importing [here](mailto:support@decipad.com).
:::

## Copy & Paste Tables

Copy and paste tables from the web or any document directly to your Decipad notebook to create a table quickly.

## Drag & Drop CSV

Drag & drop a CSV file into a decipad notebook to import that data into a table.

## Import Data From a Google Sheet or CSV Link

Create a Decipad Table from a Google Sheet or CSV table using just their link.

- To **import data from a link**, paste the Google Sheet or CSV link into your notebook and select `Import`. <br />
  If you're importing from Google Sheets, make sure your document is public.

## Connect to Live Data Sources

Connect a Decipad table directly to a Google Sheet or CSV table, so your notebook is always up-to-date with these sources.

- To **connect to live data**, paste the Google Sheet or CSV link into your notebook and select `Connect`. <br />
  If you're connecting to Google Sheets, make sure your document is public.
