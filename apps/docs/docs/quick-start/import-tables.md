## Copy & Paste Tables

Copy and paste tables from the web or any document directly to your Decipad notebook to create a table quickly.

## Import Data From a Google Sheet or CSV Link

Create a Decipad Table from a Google Sheet or CSV table using just their link.

- To **import data from a link**, paste the Google Sheet or CSV link into your notebook and select `Import`. <br></br>
  If you're importing from Google Sheets, make sure your document is public.

## Connect to Live Data Sources

Connect a Decipad table directly to a Google Sheet or CSV table, so your notebook is always up-to-date with these sources.

- To **connect to live data**, paste the Google Sheet or CSV link into your notebook and select `Connect`. <br></br>
  If you're connecting to Google Sheets, make sure your document is public.
