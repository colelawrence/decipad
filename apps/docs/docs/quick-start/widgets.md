# Interactive Widgets

Widgets are interactive blocks that allow readers to explore your notebook assumptions.

## Create a Widget

To **create a new widget**, click on the `+` button next to an empty line and select the type of widget you want to create from the dropdown menu. You can also create a widget with the keyboard by typing `/` on an empty paragraph, selecting the widget type using the arrow keys, and pressing enter.

1. **Update widgets name**: When you create a new widget, it's assigned a default name, such as Input1 or Slider1. To update a widget name, replace the old name with a new one in the top left corner of the widget. This will make it easier to identify your widget.

2. **Update widget colors and icons**. To change the widget's color and icon, click the pencil icon next to the widget name, and select a new color and icon from the menu.

3. **Place widgets side by side** to save space. Hover over the widget you want to move, hold the `⸬` button that appears on the left, and move the widget to the side of another widget. A blue vertical line should appear to confirm the new location. Release the `⸬` button to place the widget in its new location.

## Widget Types

There are several types of widgets you can add to your notebooks, including Inputs, Toggles, Dates, Sliders, Dropdowns, and Results.

- **Slider widgets** allow you or your readers to use a slider to explore a range of options and visualize its effects on your model instantly. To create a new slider widget, click the `+` button next to an empty line, and select `Slider` from the menu. You can also update the slider range by clicking the `...` button and updating the minimum, maximum, and step.

- **Dropdown widgets** allow you to create lists of values that anyone can pick from. To create a new dropdown widget, click the `+` button next to an empty line, and select `Dropdown` from the menu. You can also add values to a dropdown by clicking `Select`, typing your first value, and pressing `Enter`. To edit or delete a dropdown value, click on the currently selected value to see the list, and then hover over any value to get the options to edit (pencil icon) or delete (trash icon).

- **Input widgets** allow you or your readers to update a number in your notebook. To create a new input widget, click the `+` button next to an empty line, and select `Input` from the menu.

- **Toggle widgets** allow you or your readers to switch between `on` and `off` in your notebook. To create a new toggle widget, click the `+` button next to an empty line, and select `Toggle` from the menu.

- **Date widgets** allow you or your readers to pick a date in your notebook. To create a new date widget, click the `+` button next to an empty line, and select `Date` from the menu. You can also update the date widget range by clicking the `...` button, selecting `Change type`, and picking a range from `Year`, `Month`, `Date`, or `Time`.

- **Result widgets** allow you to highlight any result on your notebook. To create an empty result widget, click the `+` button next to an empty line, and select `Result` from the menu. Once placed, click the dropdown selector to pick a result to display. You can also create a result widget with a calculation result by clicking any result on the right side of a calculation block, and a result widget with that value will appear in your notebook.
