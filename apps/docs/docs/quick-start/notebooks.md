## Notebook Blocks

On Decipad everything is a block, that you can combine to present and analyze your data.

1. **Add New Blocks**:
   To add a new block, click the + button located next to an empty line. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut by typing `/` on a new empty line. Select the desired block from the menu that appears.

2. **Delete Blocks**:
   To delete a block, hover over the block and click the `⸬` button that appears on its left. Choose `Delete` from the options.

3. **Move Blocks**:
   To move a block, hold the `⸬` button that appears on the left of the block, and drag the block to the desired position indicated by a blue line. You can stack side-by-side widgets, paragraphs, callouts, quotes, and images.

4. **Duplicate Blocks**:
   To duplicate a block, hover over the block and click the `⸬` button that appears, then select `Duplicate`.

5. **Hide Blocks from Notebook Readers**:
   To hide a block from readers, select "Hide from reader". This will hide the block for collaborators with the "Reader" role, the pulished view, and when the document is embedded. The block will fade, and a hidden icon will appear on the left of the block.

6. **Transform Blocks**:
   To transform a block, hover over the block and click the `⸬` button that appears. Select "Turn into" to change the type of your block.

You can also reorder your tabs using `Move tab` in the dropdown menu.

2. **Move Blocks Between Tabs:**
   Select the block or blocks you want to move. Click the `⸬` button that appears on the left of the block selection. Choose `Move to tab` and select the new tab.
