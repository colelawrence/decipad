Decipad is an interactive notebook where you can gather information, build models and bring data-driven ideas to life.

Our journey of reimagining how people interact with data and numbers just began! You may run into bugs üêû, glitches ‚ö°Ô∏è and missing features üßê. Help us along our adventures! Share your findings with our team on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XQTbStHH) channel or use the Feedback button on Decipad.

## What can I build on Decipad?

Right now only simple use cases are possible on our editor, we are looking forward to expanding our features alongside our community.

For examples of what is possible and inspiration [click here](/examples/).
