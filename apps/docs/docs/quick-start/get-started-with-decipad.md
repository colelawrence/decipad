# Start Here

Decipad is an interactive notebook where you can create and explain calculations, empowering you to make better decisions with numbers.

## Who is Decipad for?

- **Curious minds** who want to understand and explain numbers in their day-to-day life.
- **Entrepreneurs**, ops, and other business-minded people that explore and explain numbers in their day-to-day work.

## We Are Just Starting

These are Decipadâ€™s early days, and your feedback is essential to us!

Decipad is being built on the web by a small group of tinkerer's alongside the community, and you are now part of it. We believe that crunching numbers is easier together, so join us and other decimates on our journey.
