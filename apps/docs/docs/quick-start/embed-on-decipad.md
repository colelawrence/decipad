# Embed on Decipad

Easily embed slides, videos, or other content from external websites into Decipad.

## Adding an Embed

Many apps and services offer HTML code that can be embedded in other locations. You can use this code to embed content in Decipad. Here are the steps on how to do it:

1.  In your chosen app, copy the HTML code for embedding and extract its URL parameter. The URL can usually be found next to the "src=" keyword within the iframe code, and it should look something like this:

    ```
    <iframe
        src="https://www.example.com/your-embed-url"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    ></iframe>
    ```

2.  In Decipad, either type "/embed" or click the "Embed" option in the side menu to open the embed dialog.

3.  Paste the URL link you obtained from the HTML code and click "Insert." This will add a block with your embed to your notebook.
