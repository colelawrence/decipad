# Charts

Charts help you visualize and analyze data, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and relationships. Follow these steps to create a new chart:

## Create a Chart

1. Type `/` in any paragraph and search **Chart**. You can select from line, bar, pie, combo, area, scatter, funnel, or radar charts.
2. Use the settings button to connect the chart block to a source table with at least two columns.
3. Choose the columns for the x and y values.
4. Alternatively, click the `Create chart` button from any table.

Charts automatically update to reflect changes in the source table, keeping your data views up to date.

## Customizing Charts

- To change colors, click the `Settings` button and select a new color scheme.
- Update chart labels by updating the x-axis in `Settings`.
- Change the chart type: Select `Chart type` in `Settings` to choose from available chart types, including line, bar, pie, combo, area, scatter, funnel, or radar charts.

## Plotting Multiple Columns

To plot more than two columns on your current chart:

1. Click the `Settings` button on the chart.
2. Select `add value y`.
3. Select an additional column from the list.

Please note that you can only add additional columns from the same source table.
