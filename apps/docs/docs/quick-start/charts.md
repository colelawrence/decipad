# Charts

Charts help you visualize and analyze data, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and relationships. Follow these steps to create a new chart:

## Create a Chart

1. Type `/` on any paragraph and select **Chart**.
2. Connect the chart block to a table with at least 2 columns.
3. Choose the columns for the horizontal and vertical values.
4. Alternatively, click the `Create chart` button from any table.

Charts automatically update to reflect changes in the source table, keeping your data views up to date.

## Customizing Charts

- To change colors, click the `Settings` button and select a new color scheme.
- Update chart labels by selecting the `Label` option in the `Settings`.
- Change chart type: Select `Chart type` in the `Settings` to choose from available chart types, including Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Line Chart, and Scatter Chart.

## Overlapping Charts

To overlap another chart onto your current chart:

1. Click the `Settings` button on the chart.
2. Select a column for the first chart using `Value`.
3. Select the second chart with `Value 2`.

Please note that overlapping charts can only be created from the same table.
