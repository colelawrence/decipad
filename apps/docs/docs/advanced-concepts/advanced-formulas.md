# Create an Advanced Formula

Use `Advanced Formulas` to explore the advanced features of the Decipad Language. <br/>
These blocks also allow you create all calculations that normal [formula blocks](<(/docs/getting-started/formulas)>) support.

Advanced Formulas enable you to:

- [Define custom formulas to reause](/docs/formulas/formulas).
- [Create `Language Tables`](/docs/advanced-concepts/language-tables).
- [Define conditions with `match()` and `tiers()`](/docs/advanced-concepts/decision-tables).

## Add an Advanced Formula Block

To **add ad Advanced Formula block** to your notebook, follow these steps:

1.  Click the `+` button next to an empty line,
2.  Select **Advanced Formula** from the menu.

## Advanced Formula Anatomy

Advanced formulas allow you add calculations on the left and get the result on the right.

## Create Variables in Advanced Formulas

Variables are labels for your numbers. They make your calculations easy to follow and let you reference the results of previous calculations.

To **create a new variable on an Advanced Formula**, follow these steps:

1. Add an Advanced Formula block from the menu.
2. Write the variable name for your number.
3. Add an `=` sign next to your name and write your number.

Take a look at this example:

**Shopping**, **Discount** and **Total** are variables and **Shopping** and **Discount** are used to calculate your **Total**.

### Variable Name Rules

- Emojis can be used as variable names ðŸ˜Ž.
- Variable names are case-sensitive. For Instance, `Discount` is a different variable from `discount`.
- Variable names canâ€™t include spaces.
- Variable names canâ€™t start with a number.
- Variables names are unique, you canâ€™t assign the same one to different values.
