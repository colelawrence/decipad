# Welcome to Decipad

## What is Decipad?

Decipad is an interactive document to gather information, build models in minutes and bring data-driven ideas to life.

## What is possible with Decipad

You can build anything in Decipad - your company’s business plan, a physics model, a bitcoin mining company model, a crypto portfolio tracker. The sky is the limit!

We're still at the beginning of our journey, but that’s our goal - **we want to empower everyone to use numbers to make better decisions.**

We’re working hard to get there 💪 but for now, you can start by exploring:

- **The Notebook** - having text and data together ❤️
- **The Decipad language** - using a more human way to make sense of numbers. Don’t be shy and take a look at our [language docs](docs/docs/language/introduction/introduction-to-the-language) 👀

## 👉🏽 A few tips before you get started

- Decipad works best in chromium based desktop browsers. We recommend you use a browser like Brave, Edge, Chrome, or similar.
- It's early, you may run into some bugs or glitches 🐞. Just report them to our team on our [Discord channel](https://t.co/fJDR4AVWeY?amp=1) or use the Feedback button on Decipad
- You can access Decipad on Safari, Firefox, or a mobile phone, but the experience might not be the best yet. We're working on it.
