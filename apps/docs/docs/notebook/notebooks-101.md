# Notebooks 101

Decipad notebooks bring together thoughts, data and calculations.

## Notebook Title

You can name every notebook by picking a title. At Decipad we like to use emojis. Be creative!

## Writing and styling

Highlight any text and a menu of styling will appear. Text can be transformed into a **paragraph**, **heading 1** or **heading 2**.

To style use **bold** `B`, _italics_ `I`, **underlined** `U` or `monospace code` `<>`.
