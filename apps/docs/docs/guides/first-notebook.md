### Duplicate a Notebook

Instead of creating a notebook, you can also duplicate them.

When you duplicate a notebook, a copy of that notebook will be automatically added to your workspace.

Take a look at our [Gallery of examples](/examples) and try to duplicate one:

1. Selection an example;
2. On the topbar you will find a `Duplicate` button;
3. Click on it to create a copy of that notebook for yourself;
4. Adapt it or transform it however you wish since you now own a copy of the original notebook.
