# Create a Notebook

Notebooks are the place where data and narrative coexist.
You can always create a blank notebook or duplicate a public one.

## Overview

To create a notebook, go to a workspaces and clink on the `New Notebook` button on the topbar.

A notebook can be a digital textbook or you can type `/` to add [widgets](/guides/widgets), [calculation blocks](/calculations) or [tables](/guides/tables) to explore data and numbers.

### Duplicate a Notebook

Instead of creating a notebook, you can also duplicate them.

When you duplicate a notebook, a copy of that notebook will be automatically added to your workspace.

Take a look at our [Gallery of examples](/examples) and try to duplicate one:

1. Selection an example;
2. On the topbar you will find a `Duplicate` button;
3. Click on it to create a copy of that notebook for yourself;
4. Adapt it or transform it however you wish since you now own a copy of the original notebook.


# Telling Stories

Decipad notebooks aren't just for numbers, narratives are built on top of words. Here are some of the tools you can use to build your story.

## Notebook Names

To organize your notebooks and help tell your story, pick a name for you notebook by defining a title. At Decipad we like to use emojis. Be creative!

## Writing & Styling

### Heading & Sub-Headings

Add headings to you notebook with the '/' command in any paragraph by selecting 'Heading' or 'Sub-heading'.

In alternative, you can use the markdown notation. '\#' followed by "Your Heading" or '\#\#' followed by "Your Sub-Heading" to insert them into any paragraph.

### Styling Paragraphs

To transform your paragraphs you can select the text you wish to change and use the tool menu to pick a style. Currently, the notebook supports bold, italics, underline as well as some custom text decorations as highlighting and code.

## Markdown Support

Besides the styling menu that pops up when you select text, Decipad supports a number of markdown style shortcuts to make editing and writing faster for those of you who prefer. Take a look at the supported shortcuts:
