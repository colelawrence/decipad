# Notebook Widgets

Widgets are no code blocks you place on your notebooks that allow everyone to interact with your model locally. They also help you establish a place for inputting data and updating your own notebooks.

## Input Widget

Input widgets are the best way for you to designate a single data point that anyone can edit. This type of definition differs from variables since they can be changed locally by anyone reading your notebook model.

### Adding input widgets

1. Type `/` on any paragraph and select **Input**;
2. Define a name for the newly created widget. You can also pick a custom color and icon by clicking on the pencil icon;
3. Finally, you can use this data point on your model and calculations by simply using its name as a normal variable.

### Exploring notebooks with input widgets

1. Access this example Notebook: [Simple Cashflow](https://alpha.decipad.com/n/Simple-Cashflow%3Ak1Zw0l2QmvbU5DIJ_XWxu?secret=vgzyDwDdJhTNN1SccetIe)
2. Update the _InitialInvestment_ input widget from 100£ to 200£;
3. Check how the loan amount that you need to quick-start your business changes from 500£ to 400£ at the end of the notebook;

## Slider Widget

When working with data and numbers, most often we want to explore a wide range of options and visualize how they affect a model. You can achieve this with a slider widget.

### Adding slider widgets

1. Type `/` on any paragraph and select **Slider**;
2. Define a name and optionally pick a color and an icon by clicking on the pencil icon.
3. Adapt its range to fit your needs by clicking on the "..." button to access the configuration menu;
4. Connect this widget to your calculation with its name as a normal variable;

When you use the slider on your models, everyone will be able to play around with the slider range and experience its effects on the notebook.
