## Single command to get codebase running with tilt

[Install mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html) and run the full development environment:

```
# Run the full development environment
mise trust
# Mise uses .env.demo for environment variables, so no env changes necessary
mise run tilt
```

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get Decipad running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you only need to install **mise** - it will handle all other dependencies automatically:

- **mise**: A development tool version manager. Install it with:
  ```bash
  curl https://mise.run | sh
  # or: brew install mise
  ```

That's it! mise will install Node.js, Rust, wasm-pack, Tilt, and other required tools automatically.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/decipad/decipad.git
    cd decipad
    ```

2.  **Trust and install tools:**

    ```bash
    mise trust
    mise install    # Installs Node.js, Rust, Yarn, wasm-pack, Tilt, etc.
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    # Create backend environment file
    touch apps/backend/.env
    # Edit .env.local with your actual API keys and secrets
    # IMPORTANT: Set NEXTAUTH_URL to http://localhost:3000/api/auth and DECI_APP_URL_BASE to http://localhost:3000 in apps/backend/.env
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the full development environment with automatic WASM rebuild, frontend, and backend servers:

```bash
mise run tilt
```

This starts Tilt, which orchestrates all development services. A browser window will open showing the Tilt dashboard where you can monitor all services.

Alternatively, you can use the old method:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development servers, and a browser window should automatically open with the application.

## Security

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for all sensitive configuration. **Never commit real API keys or secrets to the repository.**

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual API keys and secrets
3. Never commit `.env.local` or any file containing real secrets

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security information and best practices.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@decipad.com](mailto:security@decipad.com)
3. We will respond within 48 hours

## Development

This project is a monorepo managed with Nx. All applications and libraries are located in the `apps` and `libs` directories, respectively.

### Project Structure

- `apps/`: Contains the main applications, such as the frontend and backend.
- `libs/`: Contains shared libraries and modules used across different applications.

### Important Scripts

Here are some of the most common scripts you'll use during development:

**Using mise (recommended):**

```bash
# Start full dev environment (recommended)
mise run tilt         # or: tilt up
mise run tilt:down    # Stop all resources

# Manual development (if not using Tilt)
mise run serve:backend   # Backend server only
mise run serve:frontend  # Frontend dev server only
mise run wasm:watch      # Auto-rebuild WASM on changes

# Building
mise run build           # Build all packages
mise run build:frontend  # Build frontend only
mise run build:backend   # Build backend only
mise run build:wasm      # Build WASM only

# Type checking & testing
mise run typecheck       # Check TypeScript types
mise run test            # Run all tests
mise run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage
mise run e2e             # Run end-to-end tests

# Linting & formatting
mise run lint            # Lint all files
mise run lint:fix        # Lint and auto-fix
mise run format          # Format code
mise run format:check    # Check formatting

# Cleaning
mise run clean           # Clean build artifacts
mise run clean:all       # Clean everything including deps
```

**Using yarn (original):**

```bash
yarn test       # Run tests
yarn lint       # Lint files
yarn format     # Format code
yarn build      # Build all packages
```

For more advanced commands and to leverage the full power of Nx, please refer to the [official Nx documentation](https://nx.dev/l/r/getting-started/nx-cli).
