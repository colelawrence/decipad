# queries

Queries here are obsolete.
Global queries can lead to over-fetching because they are not co-located with the code that uses them, which knows what fields are needed.

The GraphQL code generation for this package has been removed. If you want to change or extend these queries, create a query close to the code that needs it in its package, such as the frontend, instead.
