It's a convenient way to explore and showcase scenarios without creating every calculation manually.\n\n<br />\n\n:::note Example\n\nLet's consider an example where you want to renovate your house and want to know how much it will cost you.\n\nYou have collected the inquire information in two tables. A first table called `Quotes` with quotes to renovate your house and a second table called `Jobs` with the type of room and the price per sqft. Your final job price will depend on the type of room you renovate and the company you go with.\n\nTo explore your options, Decipad let's you can combine both tables by multiplying the prices from the `Quotes` table with the prices from the `Jobs` table. The result is a table with a summary of the prices across both dimensions (company and job size).\n\n<ReleasePost>\n\n![Table Dimensions](./img/TablesDimensions.png)\n\n</ReleasePost>\n\nNotice how `PriceSummary = Quotes.Price * Jobs.Size` calculates all combinations and creates a summary tables with every scenario based on the quotes and type of room.\n\nIf you go with \"MBD the Firm\" and a \"Large\" room, it will cost $11.25K.\n\n:::\n\n<!--\n```deci live\nQuotes = {\n  CompanyName = [\"Bhakta Construction\", \"Precido Builders\", \"MBD Firm\"],\n  Prices = [750 £/sqft, 900 £/sqft, 435 £/sqft]\n}\n==> {\n  CompanyName = [ 'Bhakta Construction', 'Precido Builders', 'MBD Firm' ],\n  Prices = [ 750 £/ft², 900 £/ft², 435 £/ft² ]\n}\n```\n\n```deci live\nRooms = {\n  Type = [\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"],\n  Size = [10 sqft, 15 sqft, 25 sqft]\n}\n==> {\n  Type = [ 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large' ],\n  Size = [ 10 ft², 15 ft², 25 ft² ]\n}\n```\n\n```deci live\nQuotes = {\n  CompanyName = [\"Bhakta Construction\", \"Precido Builders\", \"MBD Firm\"],\n  Prices = [750 gbp/sqft, 900 gbp/sqft, 435 gbp/sqft]\n}\nJob = {\n  Type = [\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"],\n  Size = [10 sqft, 15 sqft, 25 sqft]\n}\nQuotes.Prices * Job.Size\n==> [ [ 7500 £, 11250 £, 18750 £ ], [ 9000 £, 13500 £, 22500 £ ], [ 4350 £, 6525 £, 10875 £ ] ]\n```\n\n-->\n\n## Format Combinations Results\n\nYour combinations are organized based on the first table you use on your calculations. You can overwrite this with the keyword `over`.\n\n:::note Example\n\nLooking at our example, to showcase the quote prices based on the type of job instead of the construction company, you can use the keyword `over` to control which column come first: `Quotes.Prices * Job.Size over Job`.\n\nAlternatively, you can invert the order of the multiplication since the first column is determined by the first term on the calculation: `Job.Size * Quotes.Prices`.\n\n<ReleasePost>\n\n![Table Dimensions Primary](./img/TablesDimensionsPrimary.png)\n\n</ReleasePost>\n\nNotice how on this example the first column showcases the type of room instead of the company names. <br/> For a \"Large\" room a renovation with \"MBD the Firm\" will cost $11.25K.\n\n:::\n\n<!--\n```deci live\nQuotes = {\n  CompanyName = [\"Bhakta Construction\", \"Precido Builders\", \"MBD Firm\"],\n  Prices = [750 gbp/sqft, 900 gbp/sqft, 435 gbp/sqft]\n}\nJob = {\n  Type = [\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"],\n  Size = [10 sqft, 15 sqft, 25 sqft]\n}\nQuotes.Prices * Job.Size over Job\n==> [ [ 7500 £, 11250 £, 18750 £ ], [ 9000 £, 13500 £, 22500 £ ], [ 4350 £, 6525 £, 10875 £ ] ]\n```\n\n-->\n"}]}

You are a helpful chat bot that answers users questions about Decipad with documentation about a certain feature of the Decipad language."},{"role":"user","content":"\"Can you explain how to use conditions in Decipad?\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"---\nsidebar_position: 0\n---\n\n# Conditions\n\nConditions are expressions you define to control calculations.\n\nThese are the key concepts to understand when working with conditions in Decipad:\n\n- **Booleans** : Booleans represent pairs of data with values of `true` or `false`. They are used to define conditions and make decisions in your code. Booleans can also be the result of a comparison or logical operations.\n\n- **Comparison Operators**: Comparison operators allow you to compare values and return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on the result of the comparison. Common comparison operators include:\n\n  - Greater than `>`\n  - Less than `<`\n  - Greater or equal than `>=`\n  - Less or equal than `<=`\n  - Equal to `==`\n  - Different to `!=`\n\n  **Example:** For a `Price = $200` the condition `Price > $100` is true, however, if `Price` is `$300` the condition is false.\n\n- **Logical Operators**: Logical operators enable you to combine and manipulate boolean values. The `not` operator negates a boolean value, `and` returns `true` if both operands are true, and `or` returns `true` if at least one operand is true.\n\n  **Example:** `TotalSales < $500 and Discount > 5%`.\n\nCombining comparison and logical operators allows you to create conditions that evaluate to either `true` or `false`. They can be used to control your calculations based on their outcome,\n\n## If-Then-Else Conditions\n\n:::tip Syntax\n\n` if [Condition] then [Calculation when Condition is True] else [Calculation when Condition is False]`\n\n:::\n\nThe `if [Condition] then ... else ...` statement lets you to create calculations conditionally. It takes your condition, check wether it is true or false, and performs a calculation based on that.\n\n:::note Examples\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we have a condition `Item > $200` . We want to determine if a certain item is overpriced or underpriced.\n\n`if Item > $200 then \"Overpriced\" else \"Underpriced\"`\n\nIn this example, the condition `Item > $200` is evaluated. If it is `true`, the value \"Overpriced\" is returned; otherwise, the value \"Underpriced\" is returned. It's important to ensure that the expressions in the \"then\" and \"else\" parts return the same data type. Mixing different types can lead to errors.\n\n:::\n\nAdditionally, in tables, you can use the keyword `first` with the If-Then-Else statement to check for the first row.\n\n:::note Examples\n\nShowcase a different message on the first row: <br />\n`if first then \"I am the first row\" else \"I am not the first row\"`\n\nCompute income increases based on a set value from a slider: <br />\n`if first then IncomeSlider else previous(0) + 5%`\n\n:::\n\n## Verification Conditions\n\n:::tip Syntax\n\n`assert([Condition])`\n\n:::\n\nTo ensure that certain conditions are met on your notebook, you can use the `assert()` statement. It checks a condition and creates an error in the notebook if the condition is not true. This helps in validating assumptions and catching errors.\n\n:::note Examples\n\n`assert(Sales >= $0)`\n\nIf `Sales < $0` an error will be generated, highlighting any discrepancy on your notebook.\n\n:::\n\n## Checking Multiple Conditions\n\n:::tip Syntax\n\n```\n[Result] = match {\n  [Condition 1]: [Result 1]\n  [Condition 2]: [Result 2]\n  [Condition 3]: [Result 3]\n              ...\n}\n```\n\n:::\n\nThe `match{}` statement tests a group of conditions and returns a value when a true statement is found. It simplifies decision-making based on specific conditions.\n\n:::note Examples\n\nSuppose we have a variable `Performance` with the value \"Exceeds\". We want to determine the bonus based on the performance level.\n\n```deci live\nPerformance = \"Exceeds\"\n\nBonus = match {\n  Performance == \"Meets\": 0%\n  Performance == \"Exceeds\": 2%\n  Performance == \"Greatly exceeds\": 3%\n}\n==> 2%\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Bonus` variable will be assigned the value of 2% because the value of `Performance` matches the condition \"Exceeds\". The `match()` statement allows us to specify different conditions and their corresponding results or calculations.\n\n:::\n\n## Calculating Tiers\n\n:::tip Syntax\n\n```\ntiers [Your Value] {\n         [Tier 1]: [Value or Calculation]\n         [Tier 2]: [Value or Calculation]\n         [Tier 3]: [Value or Calculation]\n                            ...\n  [Optional] rest: [Value or Calculation]\n  [Optional]  max: [Value or Calculation]\n  [Optional]  min: [Value or Calculation]\n}\n```\n\n:::\n\nTiers allow you to slice a number into different levels and perform calculations on each tier. It simplifies complex scenarios such as tiered sales commission structures or progressive tax systems.\n\n:::note Examples\n\nLet's consider a sales commission scenario where the commission rate varies based on the sales amount (`YourSales`).\n\n```deci live\nYourSales = $120000\n\ntiers YourSales {\n   $50000: tier - 5%\n  $100000: tier - 7%\n  $150000: tier - 10%\n      rest: tier - 15%\n       max: $500000\n       min: $5000\n}\n==> 112000 $\n```\n\nIn this example, the `YourSales` variable is divided into different tiers based on the specified thresholds. The commission percentage changes as the sales amount crosses these thresholds. The `tiers` statement allows us to define calculations for each tier and handle scenarios beyond the defined thresholds.\n\n:::\n\n### Reusing Tiers with a Custom Function\n\nTo make tier calculations more reusable, you can define a custom formula that incorporates the tiers.\n\n:::note Examples\n\nIn this example, the `CalculateSales` formula takes the `YourSales` variable as input and applies the tiered calculation defined in the `tiers` formula. This allows you to easily calculate sales based on different sales amounts by using the `CalculateSales()` formula.\n\n```deci live\nCalculateSales(YourSales) = tiers YourSales {\n   $50000: tier - 5%\n  $100000: tier - 7%\n  $150000: tier - 10%\n      rest: tier - 15%\n       max: $500000\n       min: $5000\n}\n\nCalculateSales($120000)\n==> 112000 $\n```\n\nBy calling `CalculateSales($120000)`, you will get the result based on the tiered calculations for that specific sales amount.\n\n:::\n"}]}

They also simplify calculations by handling conversions automatically, eliminating the need for manual conversions.\n\nThese are the key concepts to understand units in Decipad:\n\n- **Simple Units**: Simple units are straightforward and represent a specific quantity. For example, `$4` denotes 4 in dollars.\n- **Complex Units**: Complex units involve combinations of measurements, rates, or compound units. For instance, `miles per hour` represents the speed at which a distance is covered in one hour.\n- **Built-in Units**: Decipad already supports a list of several known units that you can reuse on your calculations. See list bellow.\n- **Custom Units** You can define your own units simply by adding them to your calculations and Decipad will automatically detect them. Example: `5 mugs` or `5$ per mug`. Alternatively you can use the `add custom unit` field on any formula block or column.\n\n### Converting Between Units\n\n:::tip Syntax\n`[Number] [Source Unit] in [Target Unit]`\n\n:::\n\nDecipad understands basic units and offers a conversion capability using the `in` keyword. To convert a value from one simple unit to another, use the following syntax:\n\n:::note Example\n\nConvert 3 kilometers to miles: `3 kilometers in miles`\n\n:::\n\n### Working with Formulas and Units\n\nDecipad provides additional formulas to help you manipulate numbers with units.\n\n- `stripunit()` removes the units from a calculation, allowing you to work with the numbers alone. **Example:** `stripunit(5$ per mug)` will return `5`.\n- `getunit()` retrieves the units used in a calculation, providing you with the unit information associated with the value. **Example:** `getunit(10$)` will return `$`.\n\nThese formulas are particularly useful when you need to perform calculations or comparisons without considering the units or when you want to extract the units for further analysis.\n\n## Built-in Units\n\n### Currencies Units\n\n- 🇺🇸 United States dollar (`USD`): `$`\n- 🇪🇺 Euro (`EUR`): `€`\n- 🇯🇵 Japanese yen (`JPY`): `¥`\n- 🇬🇧 Pound sterling (`GBP`): `£`\n- 🇦🇺

However, you can create custom units by defining the specific number of days in a month:\n\n```deci live\nmonth = 31 days\n1 month in weeks\n==> 4.(428571) weeks\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the average number of days in a month:\n\n```deci live\nyear = 365 days\nmonth = year / 12\nround(1 month in weeks, 1)\n==> 4.3 weeks\n```\n\nIt's important to note that when defining units, such as `year` or `month`, as a specific number of days, you may encounter limitations in certain conversions. For example, you can't convert a `year` into a `decade` because the definition of `decade` remains unchanged. However, you can still convert a `decade` into `years` since the definition of `decade` is unaffected.\n"}]}

For example, a geographic location could have dimensions called latitude, longitude, or country.\n\nIn this example, you get quotes to refurbish your kitchen:\n\n```deci live\nQuote = {\n  Name = [\"Bhakta Construction\", \"Precido Builders\", \"MBD Firm\"],\n  Price = [750 £/sqft, 900 £/sqft, 435 £/sqft]\n}\n==> {\n  Name = ['Bhakta Construction', 'Precido Builders', 'MBD Firm'],\n  Price = [750 £/ft², 900 £/ft², 435 £/ft²]\n}\n```\n\nThe final price will depend on how big the kitchen is:\n\n```deci live\nJob = {\n  Name = [\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"],\n  Size = [10 sqft, 15 sqft, 25 sqft]\n}\n==> {\n  Name = ['Small', 'Medium', 'Large'],\n  Size = [10 ft², 15 ft², 25 ft²]\n}\n```\n\nYou can now calculate quotes:\n\n```deci live\nQuote = {\n  Name = [\"Bhakta Construction\", \"Precido Builders\", \"MBD Firm\"],\n  Price = [750 gbp/sqft, 900 gbp/sqft, 435 gbp/sqft]\n}\nJob = {\n  Name = [\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"],\n  Size = [10 sqft, 15 sqft, 25 sqft]\n}\nQuote.Price * Job.Size\n==> [\n  [7500 £, 11250 £, 18750 £],\n  [9000 £, 13500 £, 22500 £],\n  [4350 £, 6525 £, 10875 £]\n]\n```\n\nUsing dimensions has two main advantages:\n\n1. You will be able to add and remove characteristics without breaking your notebook\n2. In the future, you will be able to re-use dimensions across your notebooks\n\n### Converting Units\n\nJust like everywhere in Decipad, you can convert units:\n\n```deci live\nQuote = {\n  Name = [\"Bhakta Construction\", \"Precido Builders\", \"MBD Firm\"],\n  Price = [750 £/sqft, 900 £/sqft, 435 £/sqft]\n}\n\nInMeters = {\n  Name = Quote.Name,\n  Price = ceil(Quote.Price in £/meter^2)\n}\n==> {\n  Name = ['Bhakta Construction', 'Precido Builders', 'MBD Firm'],\n  Price = [8073 £·meter⁻², 9688 £·meter⁻², 4683 £·meter⁻²]\n}\n```\n\n## Degrees of freedom\n\nDegrees of freedom refer to the number of independent variables or dimensions that can vary in a given quantity. It determines the flexibility and variability of the values that can be assigned to the quantity.\n\n### One degree of freedom\n\nIn a one-dimensional value, you have a single dimension that can vary. For example:\n\n```deci live\nCars = {\n  Type = [\"suv\", \"hybrid\", \"standard\"],\n  FuelConsumption = [23 miles/gallon, 45 miles/gallon, 28 miles/gallon]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `FuelConsumption` column is indexed by the `Type` column. Each type of car has a specific fuel consumption value. You can access the fuel consumption values using the `.` operator:\n\n```deci live\nCars = {\n  Type = [\"suv\", \"hybrid\", \"standard\"],\n  FuelConsumption = [ 23 miles/gallon, 45 miles/gallon, 28 miles/gallon]\n}\n\nCars.FuelConsumption\n==> [ 23 miles per gallon, 45 miles per gallon, 28 miles per gallon ]\n```\n\nHere, the `Cars.FuelConsumption` is a one-dimensional value, where each index corresponds to a specific type of car, and the value represents the fuel consumption in miles per gallon.\n\n### Two degrees of freedom\n\nIn a two-dimensional value, you have two dimensions that can vary independently. For example:\n\n```deci live\nYear = [date(2020) .. date(2025) by year]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Year` value represents a sequence of years from 2020 to 2025. It can be used as an independent variable to calculate other quantities over time.\n\n```deci live\nBaseFuelPrice = 4 USD/gallon\n\nFuel = {\n  Year,\n  InterestRateFromYear = 1.08 ** (Year - date(2020) as years),\n  Price = round(BaseFuelPrice * InterestRateFromYear, 2)\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `Fuel` value has two dimensions: `Year` and `InterestRateFromYear`. It calculates the fuel price for each year based on an interest rate that varies with the year.\n\n### The `over` directive\n\nThe `over` directive is used to generalize values by collapsing them along a specific dimension. It allows you to calculate totals or summaries over a particular dimension. For example:\n\n```deci live\nCars = {\n  Type = [\"suv\", \"hybrid\", \"standard\"],\n  FuelConsumption = [ 23 miles/gallon, 45 miles/gallon, 28 miles/gallon]\n}\n\nBaseFuelPrice = 4 USD/gallon\n\nFuel = {\n  Year = [date(2020) .. date(2025) by year],\n  InterestRateFromYear = 1.08 ** (Year - date(2020) as years),\n  Price = round(BaseFuelPrice * InterestRateFromYear, 2)\n}\n\nEstimatedUsage = 100000 miles\n\nGallonsSpent = (1 / Cars.FuelConsumption) * EstimatedUsage\nDollarsSpentPerYear = round(Fuel.Price * GallonsSpent)\n\ntotal(DollarsSpentPerYear)\n==> [ 40566 $, 43812 $, 47361 $, 51113 $, 55170 $, 59632 $ ]\n```\n\nIn this example, `total(DollarsSpentPerYear over Cars)` calculates the total amount spent in dollars per year for each type of car. It collapses the values over the `Cars` dimension and provides the total values for each car type.\n\n### Units and conversions\n\nDimensions can also be combined with units and conversions. You can perform operations and conversions across different dimensions. For example:\n\n```deci live\nAnimals = {\n  Name = [\"Person\", \"Falcon\", \"Turtle\"],\n  Speed = [27.33 mph, 55 mph, 22 mph]\n}\n\nRace = {\n  Name = [\"Quarter\", \"Half\", \"Marathon\"],\n  Distance = [0.25 marathon, 0.5 marathon, 1 marathon]\n}\n\nHours = sum(Race.Distance / Animals.Speed over Animals) in hours\n==> [1.6788 hours, 0.834233 hours, 2.\n\n0855829 hours]\n```\n\nIn this example, `sum(Race.Distance / Animals.Speed over Animals) in hours` calculates the time it takes for each animal to complete different races. The units are converted appropriately to provide the time in hours.\n\nYou can further modify the units and tweak the example to calculate the time in seconds or days for each animal to complete the races.\n\nOverall, degrees of freedom allow you to model and analyze the variability of quantities across different dimensions, providing insights into relationships, summaries, and conversions."}]}

You can define a table in the UI and in the language.\n\n```deci live\nMyTable = {\n  A = [1, 2, 3],\n  B = [4, 5, 6]\n}\n==> {\n  A = [1, 2, 3],\n  B = [4, 5, 6]\n}\n```\n\n## Units of columns\n\nHere, each column is a list with the same length. As with lists, you can specify the units of a given column:\n\n```deci live\nMyTable = {\n  A = [1, 2, 3] bananas,\n  B = [4, 5, 6] oranges\n}\n==> {\n  A = [1 bananas, 2 bananas, 3 bananas],\n  B = [4 oranges, 5 oranges, 6 oranges]\n}\n```\n\n## Columns with ranges\n\nYou can also declare a column like this:\n\n```deci live\nMyTable = {\n  ArrivalDate = [date(2022-02-20) through date(2022-02-24) by day]\n}\n==> {\n  ArrivalDate = [2022-02-20, 2022-02-21, 2022-02-22, 2022-02-23, 2022-02-24]\n}\n```\n\n## Columns with calculations\n\nInstead of manually inputting values, each cell in a column can be based on the outputs of other cells:\n\n```deci live\nMyTable = {\n  ArrivalDate = [date(2022-02-20) through date(2022-02-24) by day],\n  DepartureDate = ArrivalDate + 7 days\n}\n==> {\n  ArrivalDate = [2022-02-20, 2022-02-21, 2022-02-22, 2022-02-23, 2022-02-24],\n  DepartureDate = [2022-02-27, 2022-02-28, 2022-03-01, 2022-03-02, 2022-03-03]\n}\n```\n\n## Using columns as a whole\n\nSometimes, when deriving a column from another with an expression, you might want to use the whole column at once instead of doing your calculations on a row-by-row basis. For example, when you want to know the maximum of a column:\n\n```deci live\nTable = {\n  TestResults = [1, 2, 0, -3],\n  ComparedToMax = TestResults - max(Table.TestResults)\n}\n==> {\n  TestResults = [1, 2, 0, -3],\n  ComparedToMax = [-1, 0, -2, -5]\n}\n```\n\nOr analyze changes to your profits:\n\n```deci live\nInitialProfit = 500\nTable = {\n  Months = [date(2020-01) through date(2020-04) by month],\n  Profit = [InitialProfit, 300, 125, 230] GBP,\n  RelativeChangeInProfit = stepgrowth(Table.Profit),\n  PercentOfProfit = round(Profit / total(Table.Profit) in 1/100)\n}\n==> {\n  Months = [2020-01, 2020-02, 2020-03, 2020-04],\n  Profit = [500 £, 300 £, 125 £, 230 £],\n  RelativeChangeInProfit = [500 £, -200 £, -175 £, 105 £],\n  PercentOfProfit =\n\n [43, 26, 11, 20]\n}\n```\n\n## Using previous values\n\nYou can access previous column values by using the word `previous` and providing a value for the first cell, like this:\n\n```deci live\nHarvest = {\n  Date = [date(2022-02-20) through date(2022-03-05) by day],\n  Oranges = [10 oranges, 15, 20, 9, 4, 54, 23, 45, 53, 63, 54, 12, 0, 1],\n  Count = previous(0) + Oranges\n}\n==> {\n  Date = [2022-02-20, 2022-02-21, 2022-02-22, 2022-02-23, 2022-02-24, 2022-02-25, 2022-02-26, 2022-02-27, 2022-02-28, 2022-03-01, 2022-03-02, 2022-03-03, 2022-03-04, 2022-03-05],\n  Oranges = [10 oranges, 15 oranges, 20 oranges, 9 oranges, 4 oranges, 54 oranges, 23 oranges, 45 oranges, 53 oranges, 63 oranges, 54 oranges, 12 oranges, 0 oranges, 1 oranges],\n  Count = [1 oranges, 2 oranges, 3 oranges, 4 oranges, 5 oranges, 6 oranges, 7 oranges, 8 oranges, 9 oranges, 10 oranges, 11 oranges, 12 oranges, 13 oranges, 14 oranges]\n}\n```\n\nYou can also access previous values from other columns by using the word `previous`, providing a value for the first cell and the name of the column you want to access. Here is an [example notebook](https://app.decipad.com/n/X-over-X-example%3A8LC3k8ETOTHfI4bUmt0BV) using `previous` to calculate the row-over-row change of a value. The basic syntax looks like this:\n\n```deci live\nTable = {\n  Column1 = [1, 2, 3, 4],\n  Column2 = previous(0, Column1)\n}\n==> {\n  Column1 = [1, 2, 3, 4],\n  Column2 = [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```\n\n## Access columns\n\nYou can access the table columns individually:\n\n```deci live\nTable = {\n  A = [1, 2, 3] bananas,\n  B = [4, 5, 6] oranges\n}\n\nTable.B\n==> [4 oranges, 5 oranges, 6 oranges]\n```\n\nYou can then use them as lists:\n\n```deci live\nTable = {\n  A = [1, 2, 3] bananas,\n  B = [4, 5, 6] oranges\n}\n\nTable.A / Table.B\n==> [0.25 bananas per orange, 0.4 bananas per orange, 0.5 bananas per orange]\n```\n\nEven inside your table, you can refer to its previous columns if you need to aggregate them:\n\n```deci live\nTable = {\n  A = [1, 2, 3] bananas,\n  AverageBananas = total(Table.A) / len(Table.A)\n}\n==> {\n  A = [1 bananas, 2 bananas, 3 bananas],\n  AverageBananas =\n\n [2 bananas, 2 bananas, 2 bananas]\n}\n```\n\n## Add columns\n\nAdd new columns to a defined table with `.` followed by their name. Their sizes must match the existing table columns.\n\n```deci live\nMyTable = {\n  A = [1, 2, 3],\n  B = [4, 5, 6]\n}\nMyTable.C = [7, 8, 9]\nMyTable\n==> {\n  A = [1, 2, 3],\n  B = [4, 5, 6],\n  C = [7, 8, 9]\n}\n```\n\n## Index column\n\nYou can use the first column as an index for the row by using cells of text:\n\n```deci live\nFlights = {\n  Number = [\"TP123\", \"BA456\", \"EJ789\"],\n  PassengerCount = [100, 150, 200]\n}\n==> {\n  Number = ['TP123', 'BA456', 'EJ789'],\n  PassengerCount = [100, 150, 200]\n}\n```\n\nWhen you extract a column, it remembers the original index:\n\n```deci live\nFlights = {\n  Number = [\"TP123\", \"BA456\", \"EJ789\"],\n  PassengerCount = [100, 150, 200]\n}\n\nFlights.PassengerCount\n==> [100, 150, 200]\n```\n\nYou can still perform operations on that column, and it will still remember the original index:\n\n```deci live\nFlights = {\n  Number = [\"TP123\", \"BA456\", \"EJ789\"],\n  PassengerCount = [100, 150, 200]\n}\n\nFlights.PassengerCount - 100\n==> [0, 50, 100]\n```\n\n## Defining a first value in a column\n\nIf you want to set an initial value in a column, you can use the `first` keyword. This only works in table formulas.\n\n```deci live\nInitial = 7\n\nTable = {\n  Id = [1 .. 10],\n  Total = if first then Initial else previous(0) + Initial\n}\n==> {\n  Id = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\n  Total = [7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70]\n}\n```"}]}

Whether you're just starting or already have some experience, these insights will help you make the most of your time and maximize your value.\n\n## #1 Set Your Time Commitment:\n\n\n\nOne of the first decisions you need to make as a data science consultant is how many hours you can dedicate to your consulting projects. Balancing your regular job, personal life, and consulting work requires careful planning. \n\nDefine how many hours you work per week\n\nEg. If your day job already takes 40h per week, your will need to work more time on the side to allocate to your consultancy gig.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `HoursWeekWorking`, has the value of \"80 \", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `DataConsultancy`, has the value of \"50%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 5.\n\nWith this arrangement you are planning to work DayWork + Consultancy hours per week, exprRef_hJOQ85mDFmscGBI_v0_NZ hours (exprRef_xJB8NW8A6VPyiobfgQZ3L ) in consultancy.\n\n```deci\nDayWork = HoursWeekWorking - DataConsultancy\n```\n\n```deci\nConsultancy = HoursWeekWorking - DataConsultancy\n```\n\n\n\n## #2 Allocate your Time:\n\n\n\nManaging your time effectively is vital. Beyond client work, you'll need to allocate time for marketing, sales, education, and other administrative tasks. Create a comprehensive timetable that accounts for all these activities. Dedicate sufficient time to service your clients' needs while also allowing for professional development and growth. \n\nDefine your Timetable\n\nUse this timetable as a starting point. \nSelect how much time you will spend on billable tasks (Currently BillableTimeSpent or BillableTimeSpent*Consultancy hours ) and update your Billable General items to see how a breakdown of your exprRef_hJOQ85mDFmscGBI_v0_NZ  hours in consultancy work can look like. Currently you have count(Billable.Items) billable items on your list.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `BillableTimeSpent`, has the value of \"50%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 5.\n\nBillable = {\n  Items = [Support, Implementation]\n  Allocation = [5%, 95%]\n  InPractise =  Consultancy * Allocation * BillableTimeSpent hours \n}\n\nGeneralTasks = {\n  Items = [Sales & Marketing, Admin, R&D, Mastering your Craft]\n  Allocation = [30%, 10%, 30%, 30%]\n  InPractise =  Consultancy * Allocation * (100% -BillableTimeSpent) hours\n}\n\n\n\n## #3 Define Your Proposition:\n\n\n\nWhat problems will you solve, and what services will benefit their businesses. It's crucial to identify your unique value proposition and clearly articulate the value you will bring to your clients. Are you an expert in data visualization, predictive modeling, or machine learning? Tailor your value \n\nDefine your Services\n\nOn the next table, brainstorm the services you can provide and start thinking how many hours they take out of your  exprRef_hJOQ85mDFmscGBI_v0_NZ  hour budget and price things accordingly. You can use this table to model a premium on top of your hours if that specific services requires hight skill or unlocks your client in key areas.\n\nServices = {\n  Premium = [0%, 50%, 200%, 200%]\n  Items = [Data Visualization Board, Data Quality Audit, Data Strategy and Roadmap, Data-driven Decision Insight]\n  AverageHoursSpend = [20, 100, 80, 100]\n  AverageHourWithPremium =  AverageHoursSpend + Premium \n  PotencialPrice =  AverageHourWithPremium * RateHour \n}\n\n## #4 Price Your Services:\n\n\n\nYou need to strike a balance between providing value to your clients and ensuring fair compensation for your expertise and time. Consider factors such as your level of experience, the complexity of the project, and the potential value your services can deliver to determine a competitive pricing model. Experiment with different pricing strategies to find what works best for you.\n\nOnce you have that figured out capture the value you are bringing into a clear and transparent model your prospects can understand. An option you can choose is to charge by the hour. Set a fixed price for a number of billable hours and set a price for extra hours a client may ask you to add as the project progresses.\n\nDefine your Rate\n\nSet a base hourly rate as a starting point and go from there. For example, if you bill all of your exprRef_hJOQ85mDFmscGBI_v0_NZ hours at a base rate of RateHour you can make up to EveryHourBilled .  But if we look at our time table, only a few items are billable. So your value would look more like BillableHours*RateHour per week. This income can change if your services have a premium of top of your base rate for example.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `RateHour`, has the value of \"150$\", has a minimum allowed value of 50, a maximum allowed value of 500 and a step of 50.\n\n```deci\nEveryHourBilled = RateHour * Consultancy \n```\n\n```deci\nBillableHours = sum(Billable.InPractise)\n```\n\n\n\n## #5 Update your Strategy:\n\n\n\nRegularly evaluate the worth of your consulting projects. Assess the value you provide to clients and compare it with the compensation you receive. Keep track of the impact you make, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Periodically reassess your pricing model, value proposition, and workload to ensure they align with your goals. This ongoing evaluation will help you make data-informed decisions to enhance your consulting business.\n\n\n\n## Bonus: Example Project\n\n\n\nLet's consider a sample project to check out the numbers.\n\nExampleClient = {\n  Hours = [35 , 100]\n  Items = [Data Visualization Board, Data Quality Audit]\n  Fee = (Hours + lookup(Services, Services.Items == Items).Premium )* RateHour \n  AverageRate =  Fee / Hours\n}\n\nFor this client you can expect to make sum(ExampleClient.Fee)  ( an average rate of average(ExampleClient.AverageRate) on this particular job ) and you can expect to spend exprRef_QZRmXHaj1_CEsf1dpq3yx hours on the implementation alone. Since implementation accounts for exprRef_bnhAmFRolYxa2bC_xkXJ9 of your time spent per week, you can estimate that you will take exprRef_idkBZ_aZh1J750RNxb9v0 weeks to complete. Since you allocated time to tasks that aren't billable, your effective take home pay is exprRef_OfIX4gVnSmgZpg28CzjwD per hour.\n\n```deci\nProjectFee = sum(ExampleClient.Fee)\n```\n\n```deci\nImplementationAllocation = lookup(Billable , Billable.Items == \"Implementation\").Allocation * BillableTimeSpent \n```\n\n```deci\nHoursSpentProject = sum(ExampleClient.Hours) \n```\n\n```deci\nTimeEstimateWeeks = roundup(sum(ExampleClient.Hours) / Consultancy * (1/ImplementationAllocation)) weeks\n```\n\n```deci\nVariable = ProjectFee /(TimeEstimateWeeks * Consultancy)\n```\n\n\n\n"}]}

Examples include rent, salaries of full time staff and insurance. To calculate your total fixed costs, simply add up all these expenses. \n\nIn the below example, your total fixed costs are exprRef_UpOZFprTfVMqlthBw0SXc or exprRef_on84NYWyid7RiDJ_0QaYa \n\n```deci\nRent = $1000 per month\n```\n\n```deci\nSalaries = $4000 per month\n```\n\n```deci\nInsurnace = $1500 per year\n```\n\n```deci\nFixedYearly = Rent + Salaries + Insurnace\n```\n\n```deci\nFixedMonthly = Rent + Salaries + Insurnace in $ per month\n```\n\n### Variable Costs\n\nVariable costs are directly tied to your business's production or sales volume. They fluctuate as your production increases or decreases. Examples include:\n\nCost of raw materialsDirect labor costs (hourly wages for workers)Shipping and delivery chargesSales commissions\n\nVariable Cost (VC) = Variable Cost per Unit × Quantity of Units\n\n```deci\nUnitCost = $10 per unit\n```\n\n```deci\nQuantity = 100 units\n```\n\n```deci\nVariableCost = UnitCost * Quantity \n```\n\n### Semi-Variable Costs \n\nSemi-variable costs also called mixed costs have characteristics of both fixed and variable costs. They consist of a fixed component that remains constant and a variable component that changes with production or sales. Examples include:\n\nUtilities (a fixed base fee plus usage charges)Vehicle expenses (a fixed lease payment plus variable fuel costs)Phone bills (a fixed monthly fee plus usage charges)\n\nLet's say you pay a fixed base cost of exprRef_MXL16C5_iAz_iP7yjCAGS and exprRef_BX8OvRpK7QTHPns6nBCzw for electricity consumed. And, in a given month you consume exprRef_ymLwMmXERqCD44F_dRos_ :\n\n```deci\nFixedComponent = $100\n```\n\n```deci\nVariableComponent = $0.10 per kWh\n```\n\n```deci\nConsumption = 800 kWh\n```\n\n```deci\nSemiVariableCost = FixedComponent + (VariableComponent * Consumption )\n```\n\n\n\n## Aggregating Your Total Costs\n\n\n\nNow, lets build a table to easily manage and estimate our total annual costs to operate a business. \n\nEdit/modify this table for your business. Your total cost will automatically calculate\n\n1. List your costs \n2. Indicate the type: Fixed, Variable, Semi-Variable\n3. Indicate the Period: Monthly, Quarterly, Annual\n4.

You're not alone. Setting the right hourly rate is a crucial step in building a successful freelance career. It ensures you're fairly compensated for your expertise and the value you deliver. Use this calculator to estimate your break even rate and optimal hourly rate based on:\n\nYour time Your costs Taxes and fees Break even point Margin and premiums\n\n\n\n## 1. Your Billable Time\n\n\n\nFreelancing isn't just about doing the work, it's about running a business. You're not only the talent but also the admin, marketer, accountant and salesperson. A general rule of thumb is to assume that around 75% of your working day will be spent on billable tasks. This means if you have an 8-hour workday, you can realistically estimate 6 billable hours. You also need to account for vacation, holidays, and sick days when you won't earn but still have expenses.\n\nDecipad understands time, so you can modify the units as per day, per week, per year, per month by just typing.\n\nBased on the below inputs, you will have exprRef_G38vfc81Q4pZv9tsw9rTC in billable hours\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `WorkDays`, has the value of \"4 days per week\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 7 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Billable`, has the value of \"7 hours per day\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 12 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Holidays`, has the value of \"9 days per year\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 25 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Vacation`, has the value of \"10 days per year\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `SickDays`, has the value of \"6 days per year\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\n```deci\nTimeOff = Holidays + Vacation + SickDays \n```\n\n```deci\nActualWorkDays = WorkDays - TimeOff \n```\n\n```deci\nBillableHours =  Billable * ActualWorkDays in hours per year\n```\n\n```deci\nBillableDays = BillableHours in days per year\n```\n\n```deci\nweek = 1/52 year\n```\n\n\n\n## 2.  Your Expenses & Costs \n\n\n\nNow, let's calculate the costs of running your freelance business, including covering your personal expenses to support your desired lifestyle. This forms your minimum salary requirement. Additionally, tally up all your business expenses, such as marketing, administrative costs, tools, etc.\n\n```deci\nMinSalary = $50000 per year\n```\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Office`, has the value of \"$1500 per month\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10000 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Marketing`, has the value of \"$200 per month\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Admin`, has the value of \"$120 per month\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `ToolsAndTech`, has the value of \"$150 per month\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Other`, has the value of \"$800 per year\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\nYour total expenses are exprRef_3167xcYIAsFdYGlf91T7M or exprRef_rD1bXCv2teFUOdZt7UKzA .\n\n```deci\nTotalExpenses = MinSalary + Office + Marketing + Admin + ToolsAndTech + Other in $ per year\n```\n\n```deci\nMonthlyBurn = TotalExpenses in $ per month\n```\n\n\n\n## 3. Income Taxes & Fees\n\n\n\nYou won't pocket 100% of your income. As a freelancer, you're responsible for paying your own taxes and you may incur fees related to invoicing or payment processing. It's important to account for income related expenses.\n\nTo ensure your earnings cover your expenses, let's work with the assumption that your total income is equal to your costs: exprRef_3167xcYIAsFdYGlf91T7M. If you prefer to use a different estimate for income, enter it below in the 'Adjusted Income' field. Otherwise, leave it blank.\n\nYour estimated taxes and fees are: exprRef_O2xN_v2ptlLn9vAfQdZQa .\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `StateTaxes`, has the value of \"5%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 5.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `FederalTaxes`, has the value of \"5%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 5.\n\n```deci\nFees = 3%\n```\n\n```deci\nAdjustedIncome = $0 per year\n```\n\n```deci\nTaxesAndFees = FederalTaxes + StateTaxes + Fees \n```\n\n```deci\nIncomeExpenses = Income * TaxesAndFees \n```\n\n```deci\nIncome =  if AdjustedIncome == 0 then TotalExpenses else AdjustedIncome \n```\n\n\n\n## 4. Your Break Even Point\n\n\n\nBased on your estimated working hours, expenses and taxes and fees your break even hourly rate is exprRef_D_ivcLvl5wuTgxMC_tXOm .\n\n```deci\nBreakEven = TotalExpenses + TaxesAndFees in $ per year\n```\n\n```deci\nHourlyRate = BreakEven / BillableHours \n```\n\n```deci\nDayRate = HourlyRate * Billable in $ per day\n```\n\n```deci\nWeekRate = DayRate * WorkDays week per week\n```\n\n\n\n## 5. Your Margin and Premiums\n\n\n\nTo estimate your optimal rate, you may want to include a margin above your break even rate. Your margin might consider your skill level, location or competitors. At a exprRef_5F4TpJZE5o7ZWN_TUr_eo margin, your rate would be: exprRef_LojerTbM656y4L2eSYf0b .\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Margin`, has the value of \"15%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 200 and a step of 1.\n\n```deci\nBaseRate = HourlyRate + Margin \n```\n\nAnd, your time isn't the only driver of value. While hourly rates are a straightforward way to bill clients, they don't always reflect the true value of your work. For a high value project, you may want to charge a premium for your time or include a retainer in addition to an hourly rate. Consider the value you provide, your experience and expertise. Use the below table to add/edit premiums for different packages and services:\n\nProjectScope = {\n  Services = [Standard, Professional, Custom]\n  Premium = [0%, 4%, 7%]\n  Rate =  BaseRate + Premium \n}\n\n### That's a Wrap! Let us know if you need help customizing this model to your needs. \n\nRemember that finding the right balance between competitive pricing and fair compensation can take some trial and error. Regularly review your rates and adjust them as needed to reflect changes in your skills, market conditions, and client expectations.\n\nIf you would like help customizing a model for your business, join our community on Discord and let us know what you need.

Have you ever wondered how Apple is valued or whether its current market price is overvalued or undervalued? \n\nOne approach to valuing a company like Apple is to use a discounted cash flow model (DCF), which takes into account the company's future cash flows to estimate it's current value. \n\nThis interactive model breaks down how to build a DCF model for Apple and estimate an intrinsic value per share. We can then compare that to Apple's actual share price. Intrinsic value is our model's estimate of the fair value of a company; not actual market conditions. \n\nBuilt in Decipad. This is not financial advice. You can duplicate this model to reuse it or modify it to your own assumptions. \n\nFor a video tutorial on this model, check \n\n\n\n\n\n## How the model is structured \n\n\n\nThis model is broken down into five areas:\n\nForecasting Apple's Future Free Cash Flows.

Final Summary & Scenarios: Comparing our model's intrinsic value per share to Apple's actual share price and exploring scenarios around our \n\n\n\n## Step 1: Forecast Future Free Cash\n\n\n\nMy first step in constructing this model is to estimate Apple's future cash flows. There are many ways to do this, but one approach is to use historical financials to make assumptions about a company's future revenue growth, margins, and capital expenditures. \n\nI am going to look back 5 years for Apple. You may want to look back 10 years to capture a broader cycle. \n\nData Source: Seeking Alpha\n\nHistoricals = {\n  Year = [2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022]\n  Revenue = [$265.59  B, $260.17 B, $274.51  B, $365.81 B, $394.32 B]\n  EBITDA = [$81.80  B, $76.47 B, $77.34 B, $120.23 B, $130.54 B]\n  Capex = [$13.3 B, $10.4 B, $7.3 B, $11 B, $10.7  B]\n  Acquistions = [$721 M, $624 M, $1.52 B, $33 M, $306 M]\n  CashTax = [$10.41 B, $15.26 B, $9.50 B, $25.38 B, $19.57 B]\n  EBITDAMargin =  EBITDA / Revenue in %\n  FreeCashFlows =  EBITDA - Capex - Acquistions - CashTax \n  CashTaxRate =  CashTax / EBITDA in %\n}\n\nI am going to make some general assumptions to forecast future free cash. When looking at key drivers of future free cash such as EBITDA Margin and my own assumptions on the market, I am going to assume no expansion in Apple's future free cash. That free cash will maintain it's post 2020 highs.\n\n\n\nTo represent this, I will use an average of Apple's free cash flow and EBITDA from the last two years as the future free cash (FFC) and future EBITDA. \n\n```deci\nFuture_EBITDA = average(filter(Historicals, Historicals.Year > date(2020)).EBITDA) \n```\n\n```deci\nFuture_FCF = average(filter(Historicals, Historicals.Year > date(2020)).FreeCashFlows) \n```\n\nI am going to project out this assumption for 5 years as Apple is a fairly steady state business. Since I am assuming no growth in free cash, the forecast for EBITDA and FCF is the same YoY.  At the end of this model, you can explore what would happen if free cash grew or contracted. \n\nFiveYearForecast = {\n  Year = [2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027]\n  EBITDA =  previous(Future_EBITDA ) + FreeCash_YoYGrowth \n  FCF = previous(Future_FCF) + FreeCash_YoYGrowth \n}\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Terminal Value\n\n\n\nThe Terminal Value (TV) represents the estimated value of a company beyond the final year of the explicit forecast period. It creates a more complete picture of a company's value. \n\nThere are different ways to calculate TV, but one common approach is to assume that a company's FCF will stay constant beyond the projection period — in perpetuity. \n\nIn this model, TV is the present value of future cash flows in perpetuity. We can estimate TV by using our future free cash flow estimate and dividing by a discount rate. I am going to assume a discount rate close to the ten year treasury rate: exprRef_rCz2yWuvpOlarYEg7kFl3 . \n\n```deci\nTerminalValue = Future_FCF / DiscountRate \n```\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Present Value\n\n\n\nNow, we can discount Apple's projected FCF and TV to their present values using the discount rate. This accounts for the fact that money in the future is worth less than money in the present. We're assuming a discount rate of: exprRef_rCz2yWuvpOlarYEg7kFl3 \n\nWe can calculate this using the net present value function (npv) which will calculate the present value of our five year forecasted future cash flows.\n\n```deci\nPVFC = npv(DiscountRate,FiveYearForecast.FCF)\n```\n\nWe also have to discount Apple's terminal value to present value. TV is in perpetuity beyond our initial forecast. Using the net present value function, it will be 0 for the first 4 years.\n\n```deci\nPVTV = npv(DiscountRate ,[0,0,0,0,TerminalValue])\n```\n\n\n\n## 4. Estimate Value Per Share\n\n\n\nNow that we have the present value of FCF and TV, we can compute Apple's enterprise value: exprRef_Kw__Ibhf4MpWjPkLDRTY_ \n\n```deci\nENT_Value = PVFC + PVTV \n```\n\nLet's adjust for net debt to calculate market value: exprRef_Kw__Ibhf4MpWjPkLDRTY_ . (note: you can pull net debt from a company's balance sheet: source)\n\n```deci\nNetDebt = -54340 million\n```\n\n```deci\nMarketValue = ENT_Value - NetDebt \n```\n\nLet's grab Apple's latest share price using a live query and get the total shares outstanding from their latest filing (note: you can find total shares outstanding in a company's balance sheet. source)\n\nShare Price (NSADAQ):  exprRef_3gdZ9glwPWrc6Mnhk9ra2. Shares outstanding: exprRef_il1XrkiiGhYUtYt6XzQUh  \n\n```deci\nSharesOutstanding = 15943 million\n```\n\nFinally, let's calculate Apple's value per share based on our assumptions about the future: exprRef_qLAV_ocydr_ZJZnxkQ8R3 . \n\n```deci\nModel_EstimaValuePerShare = MarketValue / SharesOutstanding \n```\n\n\n\n## 5. Final Summary & Scenarios\n\n\n\nIn this model, I've made two main assumptions:\n\nA discount rate near the ten year treasury rate: exprRef_3G9koj6Tuw1OULI2cVj2G No growth in Apple's future free cash: exprRef_kHfzniEiUJhjQ882dZRob \n\nThese assumptions result in an estimated value per share of exprRef_qLAV_ocydr_ZJZnxkQ8R3 , compared to Apple's actual share price of exprRef_3gdZ9glwPWrc6Mnhk9ra2 . \n\nPlay with the assumptions to the interest rate or factor in YoY growth to future free cash to see the impact. \n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `DiscountRate`, has the value of \"4.4%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of .1.\n\n```deci\nFreeCash_YoYGrowth = 0%\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt in Decipad.

I think he should have a hobby, and he loves beer. Should he create a micro-brewery to keep him entertained and active? Let's create a financial model for such a micro-brewery for the first last(ProductionOverTime.Year) - first(ProductionOverTime.Year) + 1 .\n\n9343055666_3b2d264fda_b.jpg\n\nThis model was based on https://sharpsheets.io/blog/financial-model-brewery-template/ (with some adjustments).\n\n## Production\n\nThe first we should do is forecast the production of this brewery. Typically the production should start at a given level and then increase constantly throughout time.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `ProductionFirstYear`, has the value of \"3000 barrels per year\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10000 and a step of 1000.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `ProductionYoYIncrease`, has the value of \"20%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 1.\n\nProductionOverTime = {\n  Year = [2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028]\n  ProductionBarrels =  if first then ProductionFirstYear else previous(ProductionFirstYear) * (1 +ProductionYoYIncrease)\n}\n\nSo, we start off with ProductionFirstYear and then, after last(ProductionOverTime.Year) - first(ProductionOverTime.Year) , we end up with last(ProductionOverTime.ProductionBarrels) . \n\n## Revenue\n\nNow that we have some numbers for the forecasted production, we should figure out how much money we're going to make on sales.\n\nA brewery typically sells in 3 forms:\n\nbarrels (wholesale)kegs (for restaurants and bars)packs of canned or bottled beer\n\nFor that we'll create a category called OutputForm, which we'll use later:\n\nOutputForm = {\n  Name = [barrel, keg, pack]\n}\n\nNow, let's break down the ratio of outputs we expect to produce:\n\nOutputFormRatio = {\n  OutputForm =  OutputForm.Name \n  Ratio = [50%, 25%, 25%]\n}\n\nNow, let's see how much this yields per output form:\n\n```deci\nSalesByForm = OutputFormRatio.Ratio  * ProductionOverTime.ProductionBarrels in gallons per year\n```\n\nNow, let's define the prices for which we will sell each form:\n\nSellPrice = {\n  OutputForm =  OutputForm.Name\n  SellPrice = [100, 150, 250]\n}\n\nNow we can calculate how much we'll sell throughout time:\n\n```deci\nRevenue = SalesByForm * SellPrice.SellPrice\n```\n\n## Cost of Goods Sold\n\nThe next step is to know the cost for producing out product.\n\nFirst we need to define the raw materials, their quantity and cost:\n\nRawMaterials = {\n  Material = [Hops, Malt, Water]\n  Price = [10, 0.75, 0.1]\n  Quantity = [0.65, 10, 186]\n  Cost =  Quantity * Price \n}\n\nWe now know that the raw materials will cost sum(RawMaterials.Cost) .\n\n```deci\nRawMaterialsCost = sum(RawMaterials.Cost)\n```\n\nWe should now calculate the cost of packaging. But first we need to know, for each form, how many gallons of beer does one unit hold.\n\nOutputFormCapacity = {\n  Form =  OutputForm.Name \n  Capacity = [31, 15, 2]\n}\n\nNow we need to figure out the cost of packaging per unit\n\nPackaging = {\n  Form =  OutputForm.Name \n  Cost = [10, 15, 15]\n}\n\nWe can now calculate the cost per gallon by form:\n\n```deci\nPackagingCostByForm = Packaging.Cost / OutputFormCapacity.Capacity \n```\n\nNow, per type of product form, we know the COGS:\n\n```deci\nCOGS = PackagingCostByForm  + RawMaterialsCost\n```\n\n## Rent\n\nWe need some space to have our micro-brewery. Let's find out the costs.\n\nFirst we need to define thee size of the industrial warehouse and factory plant. \n\nHere we chose to colocate the warehouse and factory plant, otherwise we'd need to factor in the costs of transportation.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `IndustrialPlantAndWarehouseSize`, has the value of \"700 sqft\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 2000 and a step of 1.\n\nNow we need to know how much this facility will cost us per month\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `IndustrialPlanAndWarehouseRent`, has the value of \"0.85 $ per month per sqft\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\nNow we can calculate the rent:\n\n```deci\nRent = IndustrialPlanAndWarehouseRent * IndustrialPlantAndWarehouseSize \n```\n\n## Staff salaries\n\nWe'll need people to operate the brewery. Let's first define the salary for each worker:\n\n```deci\nBrewerSalary = 35 thousand USD per year per brewer\n```\n\nNow that we know that each brewer will receive an salary of BrewerSalary for 1 brewer, let's figure out the number of employees we'll need:\n\nwe'll need a managerwe'll need between 0.75 and 1.76 brewers for every 1000 barrels produced each year\n\nLet's calculate the number of brewers we'll need based on the forecasted beer production:\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `BrewersRatio`, has the value of \"1.25 brewers per (thousand barrels) per year\", has a minimum allowed value of 1, a maximum allowed value of 2 and a step of 0.01.\n\n```deci\nBrewerCount = ceil(ProductionOverTime.ProductionBarrels for 1 year * BrewersRatio for 1 year)\n```\n\nHere is how much we'll spend on brewer staff:\n\n```deci\nBrewerStaffCost = BrewerCount * BrewerSalary \n```\n\nNow, for the manager salary:\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `ManagerSalary`, has the value of \"45 thousand USD per manager per year\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `ManagerCount`, has the value of \"1 manager\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 5 and a step of 1.\n\n```deci\nManagerCost = ManagerSalary * ManagerCount \n```\n\nNow we have the total staff cost\n\n```deci\nStaffCost = ManagerCost + BrewerStaffCost \n```\n\n## Total fixed costs\n\nNow we can calculate the total fixed costs:\n\n```deci\nFixedCosts = Rent + StaffCost\n```\n\n## Gross margin\n\nWe can calculate gross margin (Revenue - COGS).\n\nFirst we need to calculate the projected total COGS.\n\n```deci\nTotalCOGS = SalesByForm  * COGS \n```\n\nAnd now we can calculate the gross margin:\n\n```deci\nGrossMargin = Revenue - TotalCOGS\n```\n\n## P&L\n\nNow I think we're ready to infer our projected P&L for the first years:\n\n```deci\nPL = (GrossMargin  - FixedCosts ) over ProductionOverTime \n```\n\n```deci\nYearlyPL = sum(PL) as table\n```\n\n\n\n"}]}

If you haven't considered pet insurance as a commercial offering we think you will find this compelling. If you already have a wellness plans offering, you can simplify your stack and have better ROI by using PetsApp.\n\nThe uplift of our wellness plans is exprRef_A6KyUm_oE3YwAQYq_833t. Across the sector, wellness plans have an average penetration rate of exprRef_iJqRnM41xS4fO4tSoM68y. Considering a average of exprRef_W0LihTpP6iFYrn8_YzFp5  and a wellness plan cost of exprRef_T6xL8yjDrslal8JY7AOIK you would be making approximately exprRef_Df4S07we2K9k1tkTwj1It by offering wellness plans to your clients.

Revenue opportunities are missed, time is wasted, and vets are prevented from focusing on what really matters: Taking care of sick pets. Don't take our word for it, you can read how we help clinics deal with this problem.\n\nSo let's drill down in how to calculate ROI for not being able to cope with all these calls. On average a clinic has exprRef_pAVDeCtURj46XQEYaZGCg missed calls per month. With PetsApp our clinics achieve a reduction of missed calls of exprRef_FyVdsnZ8NyuvXEjvzqZDg.  \n\n```deci\nMissedCalls = 233\n```\n\n```deci\nReduction = 85%\n```\n\n```deci\nMissedAfterPetsApp = MissedCalls - Reduction \n```\n\nIf we assume that exprRef_GWkr5Wx7JTLN_zwc7X3k3 of those calls would convert into an appointment, you missed out on exprRef_wyTrBxVNjZFaKeRMeQaz9.\n\n```deci\nConversionRate = 40%\n```\n\n```deci\nMissedDifference = (MissedCalls - MissedAfterPetsApp) per clinic\n```\n\n```deci\nMissedCallsROI = Clinics * MissedDifference * ConversionRate * AverageTransaction per month\n```\n\n```deci\nCallsROI = MissedCallsROI in $ per year\n```\n\n\n\n## Online products\n\n\n\nIt's easy for your clients to buy things online these day, and if you cannot offering them convenience you will find yourself loosing revenue by not being able to sell products that used to be a big part of your revenues just a few years ago.\n\nWith PetsApp we simplify this process by allowing pets owners to buy products directly from the chat. We found that exprRef_Go8nIE5t8aLEemQ3bV2px of chat interactions include product purchase discussions.

You can interact with the model to explore the impact of different scenarios. \n\n## Work as one, win as one\n\n\n\nThe Shilling Founders Fund operates a unique profit-sharing model for their portfolio companies. All founders they invest in receive a portion of the profits the fund generates. \n\nIn this model, we break down Shilling's unique approach.\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-02-27 at 20.47.09.png\n\n\n\n## Profit sharing for Shilling Founders\n\n\n\nShilling VC launched the Founders Fund as a new approach to funding that prioritizes community building. \n\nThe program is a partnership between Shilling, LPs, portfolio founders, advisors and team members. Together representing the Community.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, Shilling shares the Fund's upside with The Community through a carry pool and point system. \n\n### Mechanics of the carry pool\n\n\n\nShilling allocates a percentage of the total carried interest to the program. The carried interest is the proportion of the profits made by the Fund that is paid to the VC after all the initial committed capital has been returned to the investors.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `CarryPoolAllocation`, has the value of \"47%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 1.\n\n exprRef_UwUvgwrRVK_jUrVkBdYXR of that pool is equally distributed to portfolio companies, and each company’s founder receives an equitable split.The remaining exprRef_Q3bTfbFLmfsXs_LIIvd92 is distributed by Shilling to the Community based on contributions. \n\n```deci\nFounderCarry = 1/3 as %\n```\n\n```deci\nCommunityCarry = 2/3 as %\n```\n\n\n\n### Carry Points System\n\n\n\nThe Carry Pool is allocated using a points system. For example purposes, let's say there are exprRef_jU891ylfV_VrddiDJS2rP available to be allocated:\n\n```deci\nTotalCarryPoints = 10000 points\n```\n\nThis means there areexprRef_3Vk5MnHlqxTuH8_Ny9sTj (carry) allocated to the companies’ founders in the Fund’s portfolio. \n\n```deci\nFounderPoints = round(FounderCarry * TotalCarryPoints)\n```\n\nAnd, there areexprRef_UVDRW_QH0UQ6s8HlWjnMr  allocated to the Community and awarded based on certain achievements that Shilling defines. \n\n```deci\nCommunityPoints = round(CommunityCarry * TotalCarryPoints)\n```\n\n\n\n## Simulating fund performance\n\n\n\nFirst we need to enter the information regarding the fund along with some hypothetical assumptions. \n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `FundSize`, has the value of \"52M euros\", has a minimum allowed value of 25, a maximum allowed value of 200 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `FundMaturity`, has the value of \"12 years\", has a minimum allowed value of 6, a maximum allowed value of 20 and a step of 1.\n\n```deci\nManagementFee = 2% per year\n```\n\n```deci\nCarry = 20%\n```\n\nAnd, we need to consider potential outcomes for the Fund.

Add category lists to a table \n\nWe are working on enabling category lists in tables. A current workaround is to \n1. Create a list widget like the below \n2. Select the column that you want to add a category to \n3. Select the category you want to add and it creates a list\n\nDropdown list that exposes a variable named `Industry`, currently has the value of \"Entertainment\", where the user can select from any of the elements: `[\"FinTech\", \"Government\", \"Entertainment\", \"CPG\", \"Automotive\"]`.\n\nDropdown list that exposes a variable named `Stage`, currently has the value of \"closed\", where the user can select from any of the elements: `[\"closed\", \"negotiations\", \"contract\", \"engaged\", \"lost\"]`.\n\n\n\n### 3. Lookup individual values from a table or data view\n\nYou can't currently drag and drop single data points from a table or data view (only aggregations). To reference individual values from a specific deal from a table create a look-up. \n\nCompanySeven_Booked_Revenue = lookup(Deal_Pipeline , Deal_Pipeline.Company ==\"Company Seven\").Revenue_Booked\n\nCompanySeven_RevenueOppty = lookup(Deal_Pipeline , Deal_Pipeline.Company ==\"Company Seven\").Revenue_Opportunity\n\nDeal_Seven_Percent_Change = (CompanySeven_Booked_Revenue - CompanySeven_RevenueOppty) / CompanySeven_RevenueOppty in %\n\n\n\n"}]}

How much will your stock options be worth in the future? Check out this model to find out.\n\n## What are stock options? \n\nStartup equity most often is granted in the form of Stock Options, which are literally what they sound like: an option to buy stock at a certain date and price. You won't own any shares yet. \n\nThe strike price (also called an exercise price or grant price) is the price at which you can purchase the stock.Vesting schedule. This is the period you need to wait before you have the right to exercise your options. Exercising your options means purchasing shares at the strike price. You own shares in Deci when you exercise. Selling: Once you exercise, you can sell your shares IF there is a buyer! This is typically possible with an exit event like an acquisition or IPO. Hopefully, your shares are worth more than your strike price when you sell. \n\n\n\n## Your stock options offer\n\nCustomize the inputs below based on your offer:\n\n```deci\nNumberOptions = 8000\n```\n\n```deci\nYourOwnership = 0.1%\n```\n\n```deci\nStrikePrice = 0.5£\n```\n\n\n\nTip: If you are joining a company, you should ask what set of shares was used to compute your ownership percentage. Is it outstanding shares (total # of shares held by all shareholders) or fully diluted (all shares issued; shares held and any shares in reserve). \n\nWhat level of ownership do different levels of employees usually get? See this resource and this one\n\n\n\n## Company Valuation \n\nYour stock options value will be closely tied to the valuation of the company. Hopefully, your company will grow , and its valuation will increase, making your Stock Options value change. Example Valuation:\n\n```deci\nValuation = 3000000£\n```\n\nLet's assume all of your Stock Options were vested, YourEquityValue would be:\n\nYourEquityValue = YourOwnership * Valuation\n\n\n\n## Vesting\n\nOver time, you’ll earn the right to exercise your options per your Vesting Schedule.\n\nA Vesting Schedule is typically: 4 years with a 1 year cliff:\n\nIt has a duration of 48 months (4 years). This means it will take 48 months for your options to fully vest. Stock Options typically have a one year Vesting Cliff. (Meaning that you will need to be a decimate for 1 year before your stock options start to vest)After your vesting cliff, 25% of your Stock Options will vest. (12 months worth of equity). At your 1-year anniversary, your Stock Options will total StockOptionAtCliff\n\nTo look at your vesting progress, let's see how many options have vested for you. You can also adjust the vesting period and cliff if you are on a different schedule. \n\n```deci\nOptionsStartMonth = 2020-04\n```\n\n```deci\nCliffPeriod = 12 months\n```\n\n```deci\nVestingPeriod = 48 months\n```\n\n```deci\nCurrentMonth = 2022-03\n```\n\nCountMonth(Month) = (Month - OptionsStartMonth + 1) / months\n\nYourOwnershipVested (CurrentMonth) = if CurrentMonth >= OptionsStartMonth + CliffPeriod then YourOwnership*CountMonth(CurrentMonth)/48 else 0\n\nEquityAtDate = rounddown((YourOwnershipVested(date(2022-03)) * NumberOptions)/YourOwnership)\n\n### Cost to exercise your vested options\n\nYou can only exercise your options after they vest. Exercising means you are exercising your option to buy stock at a certain price, a.k.a. you are purchasing shares at theStrikePrice \n\nTo exercise your stock options after vesting, they will cost OptionCosts\n\nOptionCosts = NumberOptions * StrikePrice\n\n\n\n## What could your options be worth if we exit?  \n\nBefore we consider certain exits, let's account for the possibility of dilution. \n\n### Dilution Events\n\nAs the company grows, it will likely raise more money. With each raise, a new valuation is established, usually (because the company is worth more!). This means the value of your stock options are worth more. \n\nHowever, with each new raise, a company likely gives away equity to investors. So, while the value of your options has gone up. Your ownership percentage will go down or get diluted. Dilution isn't a bad thing. You still own the same number of options. Those options are now worth more, but your ownership percentage will decrease. \n\nIt's important to consider dilution in predicting the future valuation of a company. If you want to accommodate for dilution in future rounds, you can do so by changing the Dilution Event input to true or false, depending on your preferences. 20% dilution per round is a fairly standard. But, it can range. \n\n```deci\nDilutionEvents = true\n```\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `AdditionalRounds`, has the value of \"2\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\n```deci\nDilutionPerRound = 20%\n```\n\nYou can compute the DilutedSharesRatio, as the next calculation block. It is a factor by which your Stock Options equity value will be divided by due to dilution events:\n\nDilutedSharesRatio= DilutionPerRound * AdditionalRounds + 1\n\nTo account for the dilution, you can use the following function:\n\nStockOptionAfterVest = YourOwnershipVested(OptionsStartMonth + VestingPeriod - 1 month)\n\ngetCompanyPercentage(DilutionEvents) = if DilutionEvents then (StockOptionAfterVest/DilutedSharesRatio) else StockOptionAfterVest\n\nYour post dilution ownership:\n\nFinalOwnershipPercentage = getCompanyPercentage(DilutionEvents) in %\n\n\n\n### Possible outcomes for your equity\n\nYou can compute the Equity Value of your Stock Options using the CalcEquityValue function:\n\nCalcEquityValue (Valuation)= Valuation * FinalOwnershipPercentage - OptionCosts\n\nYou can play with new valuations and see how it impacts your offer. For example, for a new valuation of exprRef_GjtgLi4cOxxi4gsgJD8Ky and the above circumstances your equity value will be exprRef_2vshhIX_skApVgecqRBkT .\n\n```deci\nNewValuation = 50000000£\n```\n\nEquityValueOfNewValuation = CalcEquityValue(NewValuation)\n\nLet's compare different valuation scenarios in the below table to see your equity value\n\nIPOEquity = {\n  Scenario = [🌱 Let's go, 🌿 We are all in this together, 🦄 A wild creature appears, 🚀 To the Moon]\n  Valuation = [15 M£, 50 M£, 1000 M£, 100 000 M£]\n  YourEquityValueStockOptions = round(CalcEquityValue(Valuation ),2)\n}\n\n\n\n"}]}

There are entire books written on the topic of term sheets, but when considering a sale liquidation preference is the most important one.\n\nLiquidation preference  refers to the right of the investor (pref shares) to be the first to receive money in the event of a liquidity event such as an exit. This preference means that the investor is entitled to receive their investment amount back in full before other shareholders (common shares) receive any money. \n\nThe multiplier and participating rights are two typical levers used by VCs to protect their liquidation preference rights. \n\nMultiplier is a multiple of a venture capitalist’s investment that they are entitled to receive before other investors in the event of an exitParticipating rights, meanwhile, grant a venture capitalist the right to receive any remaining proceeds after the liquidation preference has been paid out.\n\nYou should be able to read your investment documents are get these numbers from there.

That free cash will maintain it's post 2020 highs.\n\n\n\nTo represent this, I will use an average of Apple's free cash flow and EBITDA from the last two years as the future free cash (FFC) and future EBITDA. \n\n```deci\nFuture_EBITDA = average(filter(Historicals, Historicals.Year > date(2020)).EBITDA) \n```\n\n```deci\nFuture_FCF = average(filter(Historicals, Historicals.Year > date(2020)).FreeCashFlows) \n```\n\nI am going to project out this assumption for 5 years as Apple is a fairly steady state business. Since I am assuming no growth in free cash, the forecast for EBITDA and FCF is the same YoY.  At the end of this model, you can explore what would happen if free cash grew or contracted. \n\nFiveYearForecast = {\n  Year = [2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027]\n  EBITDA =  previous(Future_EBITDA ) + FC_YoYChange \n  FCF = previous(Future_FCF) + FC_YoYChange \n}\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Terminal Value\n\n\n\nThe Terminal Value (TV) represents the estimated value of a company beyond the final year of the explicit forecast period. It creates a more complete picture of a company's value. \n\nThere are different ways to calculate TV, but one common approach is to assume that a company's FCF will stay constant beyond the projection period — in perpetuity. \n\nIn this model, TV is the present value of future cash flows in perpetuity. We can estimate TV by using our future free cash flow estimate and dividing by a discount rate. I am going to assume a discount rate close to the ten year treasury rate: exprRef_rCz2yWuvpOlarYEg7kFl3 . \n\n```deci\nTerminalValue = Future_FCF / DiscountRate \n```\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Present Value\n\n\n\nNow, we can discount Apple's projected FCF and TV to their present values using the discount rate. This accounts for the fact that money in the future is worth less than money in the present. We're assuming a discount rate of: exprRef_rCz2yWuvpOlarYEg7kFl3 \n\nWe can calculate this using the net present value function (npv) which will calculate the present value of our five year forecasted future cash flows.\n\n```deci\nPVFC = npv(DiscountRate,FiveYearForecast.FCF)\n```\n\nWe also have to discount Apple's terminal value to present value. TV is in perpetuity beyond our initial forecast. Using the net present value function, it will be 0 for the first 4 years.\n\n```deci\nPVTV = npv(DiscountRate ,[0,0,0,0,TerminalValue])\n```\n\n\n\n## 4. Estimate Value Per Share\n\n\n\nNow that we have the present value of FCF and TV, we can compute Apple's enterprise value: exprRef_Kw__Ibhf4MpWjPkLDRTY_ \n\n```deci\nENT_Value = PVFC + PVTV \n```\n\nLet's adjust for net debt to calculate market value: exprRef_Kw__Ibhf4MpWjPkLDRTY_ . (note: you can pull net debt from a company's balance sheet: source)\n\n```deci\nNetDebt = -54340 million\n```\n\n```deci\nMarketValue = ENT_Value - NetDebt \n```\n\nLet's grab Apple's latest share price using a live query and get the total shares outstanding from their latest filing (note: you can find total shares outstanding in a company's balance sheet. source)\n\nShare Price (NSADAQ):  ActualSharePrice⚡. Shares outstanding: exprRef_il1XrkiiGhYUtYt6XzQUh  \n\n```deci\nSharesOutstanding = 15943 million\n```\n\nFinally, let's calculate Apple's value per share based on our assumptions about the future: exprRef_qLAV_ocydr_ZJZnxkQ8R3 . \n\n```deci\nEstValuePerShare = MarketValue / SharesOutstanding \n```\n\n\n\n## 5. Final Summary & Scenarios\n\n\n\nIn this model, I've made two main assumptions:\n\nA discount rate near the ten year treasury rate: ActualTenYearTreasury No growth in Apple's future free cash: exprRef_kHfzniEiUJhjQ882dZRob \n\nThese assumptions result in an estimated value per share of exprRef_qLAV_ocydr_ZJZnxkQ8R3 , compared to Apple's actual share price of ActualSharePrice⚡ . Let's play with those assumptions:\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `DiscountRate`, has the value of \"4.2%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of .1.\n\n```deci\nFC_YoYChange = 10%\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt in Decipad.

We think you will be a great fit for our team and product, and we're excited to start working together.\n\n-The Company Team\n\n\n\n## Compensation Packages\n\nAt Decipad we believe a small team can have a big impact.  Equity is the way for you to share the upside of what we achieve together. \n\nWe even created this notebook on how startup equity works\n\nAt the last round, we had a share price of SharePrice . Our pre-funding valuation was about Valuation . \n\nSharePrice = $2.50 /option\n\nValuation = $100000000 \n\nThese are the compensation packages we are willing to offer you. \nEquity Value is a function of our last raise.\n\nCompensation = {\n  Package = [Package #1, Package #2, Package #3]\n  Equity = [25000, 20000, 10000]\n  Base = [$80 000, $90 000, $100 000]\n  EquityValue = SharePrice* Equity\n}\n\nThe EquityValue is how much an investor had to pay for the same number of shares you get.\n\n\n\n### The terms\n\nYour  Strike Price is StrikePrice . That means that to acquire Options you would have to pay OptionsPrice .\n\nStandard Vesting happens over 4 years, with a 12-month cliff. 25% of your options will vest 12 months after the vesting commencement date. From then on, you vest 1/48th of your options every month for the remaining three years. \n\n### How can your equity grow?\n\nWe don't know how much Decipad will be worth in the future. Our vision is to build a product that changes the world's relationship with numbers. If we do this, we believe value will follow and that early members of the team should share in that success.

At Decipad we use Carta, a 3rd party partner and platform to manage equity. \n\nCan my ownership change?\n\nYes. Subsequent funding rounds may reduce your ownership percentage. However, the expectation is that we use Decipad's funding to build a better business. That normally translates into a higher price per share. \n\nYour ownership may also increase. We may reward options for strong performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Next steps\n\nThanks for taking the time to speak to us. Review the different offers and let us know which scenario best meets your needs.

One key aspect of fundraising is the effect it has on a company's capitalization table, also known as a cap table. A cap table is a record of the equity ownership in a company and is used to track the distribution of shares and equity dilution. \n\n### Initial capitalisation\n\n\n\nIn this article, we will take a closer look at how a round of fundraising can affect a startup's cap table, including the impact on the ownership structure and valuations.\n\nThe following is a sample capitalization table that can be used as a reference. It is important to note that this table is for illustrative purposes. However, it can be used as a starting point for founders to edit and customize to match their own circumstances.\n\nFounders = {\n  Holder = [Sarah Johnson, Michael Smith, Alice Williams, ESOP]\n  Class = [exprRef_lR_6Ay8LFuu9jui5zL8Jf, exprRef_lR_6Ay8LFuu9jui5zL8Jf, exprRef_lR_6Ay8LFuu9jui5zL8Jf, exprRef_lR_6Ay8LFuu9jui5zL8Jf]\n  Shares = [4000000 shares, 3000000, 3000000, 1000000]\n  Percentage =  Shares / sum(Founders.Shares) in %\n}\n\nAn Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is a benefit plan that allows employees to acquire a stake in the company they work for. In this example, we added the ESOP before the investment because that is the most typical setting in venture funding.\n\nWhen closing a venture round, a startup is essentially selling a percentage of their company in return for an investment amount. The percentage of the company being sold, known as the \"equity stake\", is determined by the valuation of the company. \n\n### Your round\n\n\n\nThis document is a smart document powered by Decipad. You can customize it by entering your own inputs. The document will automatically update all references and accurately reflect your business.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `Investment`, has the value of \"5000000 $\", has a minimum allowed value of 200000, a maximum allowed value of 10000000 and a step of 100000.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `EquityStake`, has the value of \"20%\", has a minimum allowed value of 5, a maximum allowed value of 40 and a step of 1.\n\nValuation is the process of determining the worth of a business. The two key terms to understand in this context are pre-money valuation and post-money valuation.\n\nPre-money valuation is the valuation of a company before an investment is made. It represents the value of the company based on its assets, revenue, and future potential.Post-money valuation, on the other hand, takes into account the new investment and represents the value of the company after the investment has been made. The post-money valuation is calculated by adding the investment amount to the pre-money valuation.\n\nTherefore, the equity stake being sold is determined by the difference between the post-money and pre-money valuations.\n\nPreMoney = Investment / EquityStake\n\nPostMoney = PreMoney + Investment\n\nTotalShares = sum(Founders.Shares  )\n\nPPS = PreMoney / TotalShares\n\nIn this example, the company is selling exprRef_UVn4tlxsU6V_9JqRy32U6 of its equity stake in exchange for an investment of exprRef_FTlehV9v3taJF2ArMx0w7. The pre-money valuation of the company is exprRef_VVb1Tn7QfQN3lofjIYe8Z and the post-money valuation is exprRef_ZvQHXWmovBsxTXiheLfId .\n\nIn a fundraising round, startups typically raise capital from a mix of institutional investors and angel investors. Institutional investors are typically large investment firms or venture capital firms, while angel investors are high net worth individuals who invest their own money in startups. \n\nA common difference between institutional investors and angel investors is that institutional investors typically receive preference shares, while angel investors do not.\n\nThe price per share is the value of one share of stock in a company. It is determined by dividing the total value of the company by the total number of shares outstanding (PPS). In this example, the price per share is exprRef_A_p7hIuz6j_t8_bXvTwk4. This means that each share of the company is worth exprRef_A_p7hIuz6j_t8_bXvTwk4.\n\nPreference shares are a type of stock that gives the holder certain rights and privileges over common stockholders. These rights can include priority in receiving dividends or in the event of a liquidation, as well as the ability to convert their shares into common stock at a predetermined price. \n\nIt's important to note that preference shares are not a must have in every round, and it will depend on the company and the investors' preferences and negotiation. Also, preference shares can have different rights and privileges depending on the company, it's important to consult with a lawyer or an experienced advisor.\n\n### Allocations\n\n\n\nThe allocation table shown below allows users to customize the equity structure of their company to their particular circumstances. They can input the percentage of the company that is sold to institutional investors and the percentage of the company that is sold to angel investors. \n\nThe table will then automatically update and reflect the new ownership structure of the company. \n\nAllocations = {\n  Holder = [Horizon Ventures, Michael Brown , Tech Growth Capital, Sarah Lee, Peak Capital]\n  Class = [exprRef_GouQyDPKke0fiOZVki3_u, exprRef_lR_6Ay8LFuu9jui5zL8Jf, exprRef_GouQyDPKke0fiOZVki3_u, exprRef_lR_6Ay8LFuu9jui5zL8Jf, exprRef_GouQyDPKke0fiOZVki3_u]\n  Percentage = [25 %, 15 %, 20 %, 15 %, 25 %]\n  Shares =  TotalShares  * EquityStake * Percentage  \n  Investment =  Shares  * PPS\n}\n\n### New capitalisation table\n\n\n\nThe table below represents the company's capitalization table after the allocations of the recent fundraising round have been finalised and the round has been closed. \n\nThis table shows the distribution of shares and equity among the shareholders, including the company's founders, investors, and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) participants. It also reflects the changes in the ownership structure and valuation of the company as a result of the recent round of fundraising. \n\nCap Table\n\n## Key Takeways\n\n\n\nA capitalization table is an essential tool for seed startups to understand the impact of fundraising on their ownership structure and valuations. \n\nA capitalization table is a record of the equity ownership in a company and is used to track the distribution of shares and equity dilution.Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are a way for employees to acquire a stake in the company they work for, and they can be added before the investment, which is a typical setting in venture funding. Valuation, pre-money and post-money, the type of investors, and preference shares all affect the capitalization table and it's important for founders to understand these concepts in order to make informed decisions about fundraising and equity distribution.By using a smart document like Decipad, founders can input their own data and simulate their capitalization table while fundraising, which allows them to better understand the impact of fundraising on their ownership structure and valuations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDropdown list that exposes a variable named `ShareClass`, currently has the value of \"Select\", where the user can select from any of the elements: `[\"Preference\", \"Common\"]`.\n\nInitialStakeHolders = {\n  Holder = Founders.Holder \n  Class = Founders.Class \n  Shares = Founders.Shares \n  Type = if Holder == \"ESOP\" then \"Employee\" else \"Founder\"\n}\n\nNewRound = {\n  Holder = Allocations.Holder \n  Class = Allocations.Class \n  Shares = Allocations.Shares  \n  Type = \"Investor\"\n}\n\nCap = concatenate(InitialStakeHolders, NewRound)\n\nCap.Percentage = Shares / Sum(Cap.Shares) in %\n\nCap.Value = PostMoney  * Percentage\n\n"}]}

You can interact with the model to explore the impact of different scenarios. \n\n## Work as one, win as one\n\n\n\nThe Shilling Founders Fund operates a unique profit-sharing model for their portfolio companies. All founders they invest in receive a portion of the profits the fund generates. \n\nIn this model, we break down Shilling's unique approach.\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-02-27 at 20.47.09.png\n\n\n\n## Profit sharing for Shilling Founders\n\n\n\nShilling VC launched the Founders Fund as a new approach to funding that prioritizes community building. \n\nThe program is a partnership between Shilling, LPs, portfolio founders, advisors and team members. Together representing the Community.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, Shilling shares the Fund's upside with The Community through a carry pool and point system. \n\n### Mechanics of the carry pool\n\n\n\nShilling allocates a percentage of the total carried interest to the program. The carried interest is the proportion of the profits made by the Fund that is paid to the VC after all the initial committed capital has been returned to the investors.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `CarryPoolAllocation`, has the value of \"7%\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 100 and a step of 1.\n\n exprRef_UwUvgwrRVK_jUrVkBdYXR of that pool is equally distributed to portfolio companies, and each company’s founder receives an equitable split.The remaining exprRef_Q3bTfbFLmfsXs_LIIvd92 is distributed by Shilling to the Community based on contributions. \n\n```deci\nFounderCarry = 1/3 as %\n```\n\n```deci\nCommunityCarry = 2/3 as %\n```\n\n\n\n### Carry Points System\n\n\n\nThe Carry Pool is allocated using a points system. For example purposes, let's say there are exprRef_jU891ylfV_VrddiDJS2rP available to be allocated:\n\n```deci\nTotalCarryPoints = 10000 points\n```\n\nThis means there areexprRef_3Vk5MnHlqxTuH8_Ny9sTj (carry) allocated to the companies’ founders in the Fund’s portfolio. \n\n```deci\nFounderPoints = round(FounderCarry * TotalCarryPoints)\n```\n\nAnd, there areexprRef_UVDRW_QH0UQ6s8HlWjnMr  allocated to the Community and awarded based on certain achievements that Shilling defines. \n\n```deci\nCommunityPoints = round(CommunityCarry * TotalCarryPoints)\n```\n\n\n\n## Simulating fund performance\n\n\n\nFirst we need to enter the information regarding the fund along with some hypothetical assumptions. \n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `FundSize`, has the value of \"71M euros\", has a minimum allowed value of 25, a maximum allowed value of 200 and a step of 1.\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `FundMaturity`, has the value of \"11 years\", has a minimum allowed value of 6, a maximum allowed value of 20 and a step of 1.\n\n```deci\nManagementFee = 2% per year\n```\n\n```deci\nCarry = 20%\n```\n\nAnd, we need to consider potential outcomes for the Fund. You can modify or add new outcomes to the below table. \n\nOutcomes = {\n  Name = [No returns, Strong fund, Outlier fund, Home run]\n  Description = [The fund doesn't return above the conversion threshold, and hence only LPs see any money back., The fund has moderate return to investors, and returns slightly higher than industry average, The fund performs like some of the best firms in the world, and exceeds LP expectations for a first fund, This is one of the best VC funds of all time, and outputs one or more world renowned companies.]\n  Multiplier = [1, 3, 10, 50]\n}\n\n### Additional Formula Inputs\n\nPerformance of the fund the carry would be (liquidation preference 1x non participating):\n\n```deci\nConversionThreshold = FundSize\n```\n\n```deci\nGivenOutcome = lookup(Outcomes, Outcomes.Name == Outcome)\n```\n\n```deci\nMultiplier = GivenOutcome.Multiplier\n```\n\nAnd, we can calculate the fund results based on different outcomes:\n\nDropdown list that exposes a variable named `Outcome`, currently has the value of \"Strong fund\", where the user can select from any of the elements: `[\"No returns\", \"Strong fund\", \"Outlier fund\", \"Home run\"]`.\n\n\n\n```deci\nTotalManagementFee = ManagementFee * FundSize * FundMaturity\n```\n\n```deci\nCapitalAvailable = FundSize - TotalManagementFee \n```\n\n```deci\nReturns = CapitalAvailable * Multiplier \n```\n\n```deci\nCapitalInvested = FundSize - TotalManagementFee \n```\n\n```deci\nLPs = 100% - Carry \n```\n\n```deci\nLPDistribution = if Returns < ConversionThreshold then Returns else Returns * LPs\n```\n\n```deci\nCarryDistribution = Returns - LPDistribution \n```\n\nAnd, the carry for founders is:\n\n```deci\nCommunityCarryShare = CarryDistribution * CarryPoolAllocation  \n```\n\n\n\n## Founder Profit Sharing Scenarios\n\n\n\nNow, we can explore different scenarios for a founder that has earned points:\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `YourPoints`, has the value of \"300 points\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 1000 and a step of 1.\n\nIn the case of a exprRef_pQTbCEEbWpzj5_dKM_58c orexprRef_jVORZWMyHSk6tQG4ljL5L x multiple,  the fund returns exprRef_Mn04C8I6qN6_lVSNI6b2F on an original investment of exprRef_GWuRhVmtrWYseABugeAve . The LPs get a return of exprRef_6uAEyN2eGN3TTWxcdpcZT and the carry for Shilling + Founders would be exprRef_dhlxc3DmT65B8qo2fBAeJ. \n\nThe Shilling Community would receive a total of exprRef_epAlot_O6PdFjUs6p75Ya which would be distributed based on allocated points. With a total pool of exprRef_jU891ylfV_VrddiDJS2rP  that would be exprRef_K8de_ZBhi70lUx5YT2WAD.\n\n```deci\nValuePerPoint = CommunityCarryShare / TotalCarryPoints \n```\n\n```deci\nYourPointsReturn = YourPoints * ValuePerPoint\n```\n\nAs a founder with exprRef_Znjp97a_WeT96pLaYfkWZ you would earn around exprRef_XyDot_flX21GzkKZTKtqu \n\n"}]}

This is a very common problem in my team as our product features were spanned across multiple horizontals in the company. So to account for these into the estimates, we used the idea of focus factor. The focus factor reflects how much percent of the time a developer effectively gets to work on tasks in the sprints.\\n\\nWe took multiple iterations to fine-tune this number as we had to carefully consider the following key factors where we spend most of our time:\\n\\nScrum ceremonies (planning, grooming, retrospectives, demos, etc.)On-call responsibilitiesDesign review meetingsCode reviewsOther meetings like manager 1:1, hiring interviews, learning curves, etc.\\n\\nAfter iterating through historical data from every team member, we finally ended up with the fact that we were exprRef_GlNqamU0Hxn_HVKPpg5Wi  efficient during the sprint which lead us to:\\n\\n## Sprint Capacity with Focus Factor\\n\\n\\nSo let's review.

Also, all stakeholders know one SP means the deliverables can be expected in exprRef_U7kYy_twNOsMfc0JYPcIU working days approximately.\\n\\n## Revising Focus Factor Periodically\\n\\n\\nThe good part about the focus factor is that you can tune it proactively depending on each sprint. I always try to keep at least one or two upcoming sprints ready and I look at the kind of tasks involved and also team dynamics changes if any to see focus factor adjustments are needed for these sprints. eg: In our case, we revised it recently to consider that we got a dedicated team member to test our code changes. The same applies when developers are leaving the team.\\n\\nAs the team matures over time, developers get more productive and this means they can do a lot more in one SP than they did one year ago. This can be tackled two ways:\\n\\nDuring task estimations, we try to give a lower estimate for things we got too good at, which previously would have been costly because of some learning involved.

The focus factor reflects how much percent of the time a developer effectively gets to work on tasks in the sprints.\n\nWe took multiple iterations to fine-tune this number as we had to carefully consider the following key factors where we spend most of our time:\n\nScrum ceremonies (planning, grooming, retrospectives, demos, etc.)On-call responsibilitiesDesign review meetingsCode reviewsOther meetings like manager 1:1, hiring interviews, learning curves, etc.\n\nAfter iterating through historical data from every team member, we finally ended up with the fact that we were exprRef_GlNqamU0Hxn_HVKPpg5Wi  efficient during the sprint which lead us to:\n\n## Sprint Capacity with Focus Factor\n\n\n\nSo let's review. Your team does:\n\ndoes exprRef_nUqioyVMBsHvt1x2DVazb sprintshas exprRef_EfLb_wu1DSggxjIo3MVcl developersEach story point means SP You are assuming your developers work on coding tasks exprRef_GlNqamU0Hxn_HVKPpg5Wi of the time.\n\nWith the definition of focus factor clear, let us try to accommodate it in our calculations:\n\n```deci\nFocusedHoursSprint = HoursPerSprint * Focus\n```\n\n```deci\nEffectiveSPSprint = SPPerSprint * Focus\n```\n\n```deci\nEffectiveSP = SP / Focus\n```\n\n```deci\nEffectiveSPTime = stripunit(round(EffectiveSP in developer_day, 1))\n```\n\nThis means you have exprRef_4VwbYg3gwQuBkPqnQi_Y3 available per sprint (exprRef_7sKZimX6pC9qdXh39pgsq)\n\nAs developers, we continue to estimate tasks without considering any interruptions as these are already accounted for in the capacity planning. Also, all stakeholders know one SP means the deliverables can be expected in exprRef_U7kYy_twNOsMfc0JYPcIU working days approximately.\n\n## Revising Focus Factor Periodically\n\n\n\nThe good part about the focus factor is that you can tune it proactively depending on each sprint. I always try to keep at least one or two upcoming sprints ready and I look at the kind of tasks involved and also team dynamics changes if any to see focus factor adjustments are needed for these sprints. eg: In our case, we revised it recently to consider that we got a dedicated team member to test our code changes. The same applies when developers are leaving the team.\n\nAs the team matures over time, developers get more productive and this means they can do a lot more in one SP than they did one year ago. This can be tackled two ways:\n\nDuring task estimations, we try to give a lower estimate for things we got too good at, which previously would have been costly because of some learning involved. This is what we adopted as its natural solution.Increase the focus factor.\n\n"}]}

How much will your stock options be worth in the future? Check out this model to find out.\n\n## 🤔 What are stock options? \n\n### The basics\n\nStartup equity most often is granted in the form of Stock Options, which are literally what they sound like: an option to buy stock at a certain date and price. You won't own any shares yet. \n\nThe strike price (also called an exercise price or grant price) is the price at which you can purchase the stock.Vesting schedule. This is the period you need to wait before you have the right to exercise your options. Exercising your options means purchasing shares at the strike price. You own shares in Deci when you exercise. Selling: Once you exercise, you can sell your shares IF there is a buyer! This is typically possible with an exit event like an acquisition or IPO. Hopefully, your shares are worth more than your strike price when you sell. \n\nToo complicated? A video on this subject might help you to get started. Here's a good one: \nStartup Stock Options & Equity 101 for Tech Employees by Una Kravets:Link\n\n\n\n## 🎁 Your stock options offer\n\nCustomize the inputs below based on your offer:\n\n```deci\nNumberOptions = 8000\n```\n\n```deci\nYourOwnership = 0.1%\n```\n\n```deci\nStrikePrice = 0.5£\n```\n\nWe base ownership percentage on fully diluted shares (total # of shares issued)\n\n💡Tip: If you are joining a company, you should ask what set of shares was used to compute your ownership percentage. Is it outstanding shares (total # of shares held by all shareholders) or fully diluted (all shares issued; shares held and any shares in reserve). \n\nWhat level of ownership do different levels of employees usually get? See this resource and this one\n\n\n\n## ✨ Company Valuation \n\nYour Stock Options Value will be closely tied to the Valuation as a company\n\nHopefully, your Company will grow 🌱, and its Valuation will increase, making your Stock Options value change. Example Valuation:\n\n```deci\nValuation = 3000000£\n```\n\nLet's assume all of your Stock Options were vested, YourEquityValue would be:\n\nYourEquityValue = YourOwnership * Valuation\n\n\n\n## 📅 Vesting\n\nOver time, you’ll earn the right to exercise your options per your Vesting Schedule.\n\nA Vesting Schedule is typically: 4 years with a 1 year cliff:\n\nIt has a duration of 48 months (4 years). This means it will take 48 months for your options to fully vest. Stock Options typically have a one year Vesting Cliff. (Meaning that you will need to be a decimate for 1 year before your stock options start to vest)After your vesting cliff, 25% of your Stock Options will vest. (12 months worth of equity). At your 1-year anniversary, your Stock Options will total StockOptionAtCliff\n\nTo look at your vesting progress, let's see how many options have vested for you. You can also adjust the vesting period and cliff if you are on a different schedule. \n\n```deci\nOptionsStartMonth = 2020-04\n```\n\n```deci\nCliffPeriod = 12 months\n```\n\n```deci\nVestingPeriod = 48 months\n```\n\n```deci\nCurrentMonth = 2022-03\n```\n\nCountMonth(Month) = (Month - OptionsStartMonth + 1) / months\n\nYourOwnershipVested (CurrentMonth) = if CurrentMonth >= OptionsStartMonth + CliffPeriod then YourOwnership*CountMonth(CurrentMonth)/48 else 0\n\nEquityAtDate = rounddown((YourOwnershipVested(date(2022-03)) * NumberOptions)/YourOwnership)\n\n### 💵 Cost to exercise your vested options\n\nYou can only exercise your options after they vest. Exercising means you are exercising your option to buy stock at a certain price, a.k.a. you are purchasing shares at theStrikePrice \n\nTo exercise your stock options after vesting, they will cost OptionCosts\n\nOptionCosts = NumberOptions * StrikePrice\n\n\n\n\n\n## 🦄 What could your options be worth if we exit?  \n\nBefore we consider certain exits, let's account for the possibility of dilution. \n\n### 🌊 Dilution Events\n\nAs the company grows, it will likely raise more money. With each raise, a new valuation is established, usually (because the company is worth more!). This means the value of your stock options are worth more. \n\nHowever, with each new raise, we likely give away equity to investors. So, while the value of your options has gone up. Your ownership percentage will go down or get diluted. \n\nDilution isn't a bad thing. You still own the same number of options. Those options are now worth more, butYourOwnershippercentage of [0.75%] will decrease. \n\nIt's important to consider dilution in predicting the future valuation of a company. If you want to accommodate for dilution in future rounds, you can do so by changing the DilutionEventsto true or false, depending on your preferences. 20% DilutionPerRound is a fairly standard. But, it can range. \n\n```deci\nDilutionEvents = true\n```\n\nSlider that exposes a variable named `AdditionalRounds`, has the value of \"2\", has a minimum allowed value of 0, a maximum allowed value of 10 and a step of 1.\n\n```deci\nDilutionPerRound = 20%\n```\n\nYou can compute the DilutedSharesRatio, as the next calculation block. It is a factor by which your Stock Options equity value will be divided by due to dilution events:\n\nDilutedSharesRatio= DilutionPerRound * AdditionalRounds + 1\n\nTo account for the dilution, you can use the following function:\n\nStockOptionAfterVest = YourOwnershipVested(OptionsStartMonth + VestingPeriod - 1 month)\n\ngetCompanyPercentage(DilutionEvents) = if DilutionEvents then (StockOptionAfterVest/DilutedSharesRatio) else StockOptionAfterVest\n\nYour post dilution ownership:\n\nFinalOwnershipPercentage = getCompanyPercentage(DilutionEvents) in %\n\n\n\n### 🔮 Possible outcomes for your equity\n\nYou can compute the Equity Value of your Stock Options using the CalcEquityValue function:\n\nCalcEquityValue (Valuation)= Valuation * FinalOwnershipPercentage - OptionCosts\n\nYou can play with NewValuation and see how it impacts your offer. For example, for a new valuation of £50M:\n\n```deci\nNewValuation = 50000000£\n```\n\nEquityValueOfNewValuation = CalcEquityValue(NewValuation)\n\n\n\nLet's explore different scenarios on the next table.\n\nIPOEquity = {\n  Scenario = [🌱 Let's go, 🌿 We are all in this together, 🦄 A wild creature appears, 🚀 To the Moon]\n  Valuation = [15 M£, 50 M£, 1000 M£, 100 000 M£]\n  YourEquityValueStockOptions = round(CalcEquityValue(Valuation ),2)\n}\n\n\n\n"}]}
