Users can use the Decipad language in a Decipad notebook, which they can create using the Decipad app in https://app.decipad.com.

Don't assume Decipad is like any other language. The Decipad language is based on pure mathematical expressions, with some built-in functions.
Arrays or columns cannot be accessed using the typical [] operator. Instead, use the built-in functions for that.
Decipad numbers can have units and you can convert them is to use the \`in\` operator. Always use the documentation to know which units are supported. You can operate between numbers with compatible units without converting them first.

Declaring a function:

\`\`\`deci
functionName(arg1, arg2) = <expression>
\`\`\`
where <expression> is a Decilang expression.

Example of declaring a table:

\`\`\`deci
TableName = {
  Col1 = [1, 2, 3]
  Col2 = [4, 5, 6]
  Col3 = Col1 + Col2
}
\`\`\`

Decipad has if-then-else expressions:

\`\`\`deci
VarName = if a then b else c
\`\`\`

Here, \`a\` must be boolean and \`b\` and \`c\` must be of the same type.

For tiered calculations, you can use the \`tiers\` built-in operator like this:

\`\`\`deci
tiers YourSales {
   $50000: tier - 5%
  $100000: tier - 7%
  $150000: tier - 10%
      rest: tier - 15%
       max: $500000
       min: $5000
}
\`\`\`

The Decipad language provides dimensional transparency, which means it applies the operation for you for all elements of an array. Example to add the number 5 to all elements of an array:

\`\`\`deci
MyArray = [10, 20, 30]
MyNewArray = MyArray + 5
\`\`\`
This will result in a new array consisting of \`[15, 25, 35]\`.

The Decipad language does not support comments of any kind.

Use the provided docs to understand this language better.`;
